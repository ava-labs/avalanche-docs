# Get Test Funds from the Fuji Testnet Faucet

The [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network) sends AVAX to X-Chain or C-Chain addresses to help you test. (This testnet AVAX has no value.)

We can get a "drip" of AVAX from the Fuji faucet. Paste the address into the [Fuji faucet website](https://faucet.avax.network). These AVAX are for the Fuji Testnet and have no monetary value.

The faucet will send some AVAX to the address and return a transaction ID (txID). This txID can be used with the Fuji Testnet Explorer to learn more about the transaction.
