# Avalanche Mainnet

The Avalanche Mainnet refers to the main network of the Avalanche blockchain where real transactions and smart contract executions occur. It is the final and production-ready version of the blockchain where users can interact with the network and transact with real world assets.

A _network of networks_, Avalanche Mainnet includes the [Primary Network](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform.md) formed by the X, P, and C-Chain, as well as all in-production [Subnets](/learn/avalanche/subnets-overview.md). These Subnets are independent blockchain sub-networks that can be tailored to specific application use cases, use their own consensus mechanisms, define their own token economics, and be run by different [virtual machines](docs/learn/avalanche/virtual-machines.md).
