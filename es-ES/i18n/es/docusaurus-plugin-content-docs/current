# What Is a Subnet?

A **Subnet** is a sovereign network which defines its own rules regarding its membership and token economics. It is composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Each blockchain is validated by exactly one Subnet, while a Subnet can validate many blockchains.

Avalanche's [Primary Network](avalanche-platform.md) is a special Subnet running three blockchains:

- The Platform Chain [(P-Chain)](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform#p-chain)
- The Contract Chain [(C-Chain)](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform#c-chain)
- The Exchange Chain [(X-Chain)](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform#x-chain)

:::info
Every validator in a Subnet **must** also validate the Primary Network.

Node operators that validate a Subnet with multiple chains do not need to run multiple machines for validation. For example, the Primary Network is a Subnet with three coexisting chains, all of which can be validated by a single node, or a single machine.

## Advantages

### Independent Networks

- Subnets use virtual machines to specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security.
- Each Subnet's performance is isolated from other Subnets in the ecosystem, so increased usage on one Subnet won't affect another.
- Subnets can have their own token economics with their own native tokens, fee markets, and incentives determined by the Subnet deployer.
- One Subnet can host multiple blockchains with customized [virtual machines](virtual-machines.md).

### Native Interoperability

- Avalanche Warp Messaging enables native cross-Subnet communication and allows Virtual Machine (VM) developers to implement arbitrary communication protocols between any two Subnets.


### Accommodate Application-Specific Requirements

_Different blockchain-based applications may require validators to have certain properties such as large amounts of RAM or CPU power._

- A Subnet could require that validators meet certain [hardware requirements](/nodes/run/node-manually.md#requirements) so that the application doesn’t suffer from low performance due to slow validators.

### Launch a Network Designed With Compliance In Mind

_Avalanche’s Subnet architecture makes regulatory compliance manageable. As mentioned above, a Subnet may require validators to meet a set of requirements._

Some examples of requirements the creators of a Subnet may choose include:

- Validators must be located in a given country.
- Validators must pass KYC/AML checks.
- Validators must hold a certain license.

### Control The Privacy of On-Chain Data

_Subnets are ideal for organizations interested in keeping their information private._

- Institutions conscious of their stakeholders' privacy can create a private Subnet where the contents of the blockchains would be visible only to a set of pre-approved validators. Define this at creation with a [single parameter](/nodes/configure/subnet-configs.md#private-subnet).

### Validator Sovereignty

_In a heterogeneous network of blockchains, some validators will not want to validate certain blockchains because they simply have no interest in those blockchains._

- The Subnet model enables validators to concern themselves only with blockchain networks they choose to participate in. This greatly reduces the computational burden on validators.

## Develop Your Own Subnet

Subnets on Avalanche are deployed by default with [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm#subnet-evm), a fork of go-ethereum. It implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports Solidity smart contracts as well as most other Ethereum client functionality.

To get started, check out the tutorials in our [Subnets](/build/subnet/hello-subnet.md) section.
