# Build Your First Subnet

This tutorial walks you through the process of using Avalanche-CLI to create a Subnet, deploy it to a local network, and connect to it with Core wallet.

The first step of learning Subnet development is learning to use [Avalanche-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli).

## Installation

The fastest way to install the latest Avalanche-CLI binary is by running the install script:

```shell
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The binary installs inside the `~/bin` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

You can run all of the commands in this tutorial by calling `~/bin/avalanche`.

You can also add the command to your system path by running

```shell
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

If you add it to your path, you should be able to call the program anywhere with just `avalanche`. To add it to your path permanently, add an export command to your shell initialization script (ex: .bashrc or .zshrc).

For more detailed installation instructions, see [Avalanche-CLI Installation](/tooling/cli-guides/install-avalanche-cli.md)

## Create Your Subnet Configuration

This tutorials teaches you how to create an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based Subnet. To do so, you use Subnet-EVM, Avalanche's Subnet fork of the EVM. It supports airdrops, custom fee tokens, configurable gas parameters, and multiple stateful precompiles. To learn more, take a look at [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm). The goal of your first command is to create a Subnet-EVM configuration.

The Subnet command suite provides a collection of tools for developing and deploying Subnets.

The Subnet Creation Wizard walks you through the process of creating your Subnet. To get started, first pick a name for your Subnet. This tutorial uses `mySubnet`, but feel free to substitute that with any name you like. Once you've picked your name, run

`avalanche subnet create mySubnet`

The following sections walk through each question in the wizard.

### Choose Your VM

Select `SubnetEVM`.

### Enter Your Subnet's ChainID

Choose a positive integer for your EVM-style ChainID.

In production environments, this ChainID needs to be unique and not shared with any other chain. You can visit [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to verify that your selection is unique. Because this is a development Subnet, feel free to pick any number. Stay away from well-known ChainIDs such as 1 (Ethereum) or 43114 (Avalanche C-Chain) as those may cause issues with other tools.

### Token Symbol

Enter a string to name your Subnet's native token. The token symbol doesn't necessarily need to be unique. Example token symbols are AVAX, JOE, and BTC.

### Subnet-EVM Version

Select `Use latest version`.

### Gas Fee Configuration

This question determines how to set gas fees on your Subnet.

Select `Low disk use / Low Throughput 1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)`.

### Airdrop

Select `Airdrop 1 million tokens to the default address (do not use in production)`.

This address's private key is well-known, so DO NOT send any production funds to it. Attackers would likely drain the funds instantly.

When you are ready to start more mature testing, select `Customize your airdrop` to distribute funds to additional addresses.

### Precompiles

Precompiles are Avalanche's way of customizing the behavior of your Subnet. They're strictly an advanced feature, so you can safely select `No` for now.

### Wrapping Up

If all worked successfully, the command prints `Successfully created subnet configuration`.

You've successfully created your first Subnet configuration. Now it's time to deploy it.

## Deploying Subnets Locally

To deploy your Subnet, run

`avalanche subnet deploy mySubnet`

Make sure to substitute the name of your Subnet if you used a different one than `mySubnet`.

Next, select `Local Network`.

This command boots a five node Avalanche network on your machine. It needs to download the latest versions of AvalancheGo and Subnet-EVM. The command may take a couple minutes to run.

Note: If you run `bash` on your shell and are running Avalanche-CLI on ARM64 on Mac, you will require Rosetta 2 to be able to deploy Subnets locally. You can download Rosetta 2 using `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` .

If all works as expected, the command output should look something like this:

You can use the deployment details to connect to and interact with your Subnet. Now it's time to interact with it.

## Interacting with Your Subnet

You can use the value provided by `Browser Extension connection details` to connect to your Subnet with Core, MetaMask, or any other wallet.

:::note

To allow API calls from other machines, use `--http-host=0.0.0.0` in the config.

This tutorial uses Core.

### Importing the Test Private Key

:::warning
This address derives from a well-known private key. Anyone can steal funds sent to this address. Only use it on development networks that only you have access to. If you send production funds to this address, attackers may steal them instantly.
:::

First, you need to import your airdrop private key into Core.

In the Accounts screen, select the `Imported` tab. Click on `Import private key`.

![Import Account](/img/first-subnet/import1.png)

Here, enter the private key. Import the well-known private key `0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027`.

![Enter private key](/img/first-subnet/import2.png)

Next, rename the Core account to prevent confusion. On the `Imported` tab, click on the pen icon next to your account. Rename the account `DO NOT USE -- Public test key` to prevent confusion with any personal wallets.

![Rename Account](/img/first-subnet/import3.png)

![Rename Account](/img/first-subnet/import4.png)

### Connect to the Subnet

Next, you need to add your Subnet to Core's networks.

In the Core Extension click, `See All Networks` and then select the `+ ` icon in the top right.

![Add network](/img/first-subnet/network1.png)

Enter your Subnet's details, found in the output of your `avalanche subnet deploy` [command](#deploying-subnets-locally), into the form and click `Save`.

![Add network 2](/img/first-subnet/network2.png)

If all worked as expected, your balance should read 1 million tokens. Your Subnet is ready for action. You might want to try to [Deploy a Smart Contract on Your Subnet-EVM Using Remix and Core](/build/subnet/utility/deploy-smart-contract-to-subnet.md).

## Next Steps

Congrats Subnetooooor, you just deployed your first Subnet!

After you feel comfortable with this deployment flow, try deploying smart contracts on your chain with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). You can also experiment with customizing your Subnet by addingprecompiles or adjusting the airdrop.

Once you've developed a stable Subnet you like, see [Create an EVM Subnet on Fuji Testnet](/build/subnet/deploy/fuji-testnet-subnet.md) to take your Subnet one step closer to production.

Good Subnetting!

## FAQ

**How is the Subnet ID determined upon creation?**

The Subnet ID is the hash of the transaction that created the Subnet.
