# Overview

## Introduction

[Avalanche](https://avax.network) is an open-source platform for launching [decentralized
applications](https://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587146-what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp)
and enterprise [blockchain](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4064677-what-is-a-blockchain)
deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first decentralized
smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction
finality. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.

A key difference between Avalanche and other decentralized networks is the consensus protocol. Over
time, people have come to a false understanding that blockchains have to be slow and not scalable.
The Avalanche protocol employs a novel approach to consensus to achieve its strong safety
guarantees, quick finality, and high-throughput without compromising decentralization.

## AVAX

AVAX is the native token of Avalanche. It’s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for
fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple
Subnets created on Avalanche. `1 nAVAX` is equal to `0.000000001 AVAX`.

## Avalanche Consensus Protocol

![Consensus Comparison](/img/Consensus-protocol-comparison.png)

Protocols in the Avalanche family operate through repeated sub-sampled voting. When a
[validator](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4064704-what-is-a-blockchain-validator) is
determining whether a
[transaction](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587384-what-is-a-transaction) should be
accepted or rejected, it asks a small, random subset of validators whether they think the
transaction should be accepted or rejected. If the queried validator thinks the transaction is
invalid, has already rejected the transaction, or prefers a conflicting transaction, it replies that
it thinks the transaction should be rejected. Otherwise, it replies that it thinks the transaction
should be accepted.

If a sufficiently large portion (_alpha_ α) of the validators sampled reply that they think the
transaction should be accepted, the validator prefers to accept the transaction. That is, when it is
queried about the transaction in the future, it will reply that it thinks the transaction should be
accepted. Similarly, the validator will prefer to reject the transaction if a sufficiently large
portion of the validators replies that they think the transaction should be rejected.

The validator repeats this sampling process until _alpha_ of the validators queried reply the same
way (accept or reject) for _beta_ β consecutive rounds.

In the common case when a transaction has no conflicts, finalization happens very quickly. When
conflicts exist, honest validators quickly cluster around conflicting transactions, entering a
positive feedback loop until all correct validators prefer that transaction. This leads to the
acceptance of non-conflicting transactions and the rejection of conflicting transactions.

![How Avalanche Consensus Works](/img/howavalancheconsensusworks.png)

It is guaranteed (with high probability based on system parameters) that if any honest validator
accepts or rejects a transaction, all honest validators will accept or reject that transaction.

## Snowman Consensus Protocol

Snowman is a chain-optimized consensus protocol-high-throughput, totally ordered, and great for
smart contracts. Snowman is powered by the [Avalanche consensus
protocol](./#avalanche-consensus-protocol). Both
[P-Chain](overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform.md#platform-chain-p-chain) and
[C-Chain](overview/getting-started/avalanche-platform.md#contract-chain-c-chain) implement the
Snowman consensus protocol.

## Key Features

### Speed

Uses a novel consensus protocol, developed by a team of Cornell computer scientists, and is able to
permanently confirm transactions in under 1 second.

### Scalability

Capable of 4,500 transactions per second-an order of magnitude greater than existing blockchains.

### Security

Ensures stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other networks.

### Flexibility

Easily create custom blockchains and decentralized apps that contain almost any arbitrary logic.

### Sustainability

Uses energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithm rather than proof-of-work.

### Smart Contract Support

Supports the creation of Solidity smart contracts and your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix,
MetaMask, Truffle, and more.

### Private and Public Blockchains

Create your own public or private blockchains.

### Designed for Finance

Native support for easily creating and trading digital smart assets with complex, custom rule-sets.
