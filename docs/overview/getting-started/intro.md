# Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications (Dapps) in one
interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first ecosystem designed to accommodate
the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality.

Avalanche empowers developers to join a rich ecosystem of blockchains known as Subnets. Subnets
are isolated clusters of the Avalanche network that allow any Dapp to run on its own dedicated set
of nodes, enabling unmatched levels of fault-tolerance and customization for any use-case. Each
Subnet is isolated from other Subnets in the ecosystem, so increased usage on a single Subnet 
doesn't affect other Subnets on Avalanche.

In Avalanche, developers can create their Dapps by implementing them as a Virtual Machine (VM).
EVM developers can build on Avalanche's implementation of the EVM straight out-of-the box, or build
their own custom VM for advanced use cases. VMs are supported in multiple languages including Go
and Rust, giving developers unparalleled amounts of flexibility in their implementation.

Avalanche employs a novel consensus algorithm which offers strong safety guarantees, quick finality
times, and high throughput, without compromising decentralization. Avalanche uses proof-of-stake and
is incredibly energy-efficient and sustainable compared to proof-of-work blockchains. Avalanche can
run on easily accessible consumer-grade hardware, and consumes the same amount of energy as 46 US
households. The entire Avalanche network consumes only 0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by
Bitcoin.

## Building on Avalanche

### Virtual Machines

Avalanche allows developers to build Dapps through the Virtual Machine (VM) framework. VMs are 
language agnostic and give developers unmatched levels of flexibility and customization in the
implementation of their applications.

### Subnets

Subnets are Avalanche's solution to scaling, and allow Avalanche to scale to handle an infinite
amount of interoperable Dapps in its ecosystem.

## Technology

### Consensus

Avalanche uses a revolutionary consensus algorithm that is scalable, robust, and energy-efficient.
Avalanche consensus offers stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other
networks.
