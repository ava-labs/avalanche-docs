# Avalanche Platform

Avalanche is a heterogeneous network of blockchains. As opposed to homogeneous networks, where
all applications reside in the same chain, heterogeneous networks allow separate chains to be
created for different applications.

The Primary Network is a special [Subnet](../../subnets/README.md) that contains all validators
(including validators of any custom Subnets). A node can become a validator for the Primary
Network by staking at least 2,000 AVAX.

All validators as members of the Primary Network are required to validate and secure the
following 3 blockchains:
the [**Exchange Chain (X-Chain)**](#exchange-chain-x-chain),
the [**Platform Chain (P-Chain)**](#platform-chain-p-chain), and
the [**Contract Chain (C-Chain**)](#contract-chain-c-chain).

## Contract Chain (C-Chain)

The **C-Chain** is an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
The [C-Chain’s API](../../apis/avalanchego/apis/c-chain.md) supports Geth's API and supports the
creation and execution of smart contracts written in Solidity.

The C-Chain is an instance of the Coreth Virtual Machine.

## Platform Chain (P-Chain)

The **P-Chain** is responsible for all validator and Subnet-level operations.
The [P-Chain API](../../apis/avalanchego/apis/p-chain.md) supports the creation of new
blockchains and Subnets, the addition of validators to Subnets, staking operations, and other
platform-level operations.

The P-Chain is an instance of the Platform Virtual Machine.

## Exchange Chain (X-Chain)

The **X-Chain** is responsible for operations on digital smart assets known as **Avalanche Native
Tokens**. A smart asset is a representation of a real-world resource (for example, equity, or a
bond) with sets of rules that govern its behavior, like "can’t be traded until tomorrow."
The [X-Chain API](../../apis/avalanchego/apis/x-chain.md) supports the creation and trade of
Avalanche Native Tokens.

One asset traded on the X-Chain is AVAX. When you issue a transaction to a blockchain on Avalanche,
you pay a fee denominated in AVAX.

The X-Chain is an instance of the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM).
