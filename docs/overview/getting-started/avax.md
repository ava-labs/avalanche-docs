# Overview

AVAX is the native utility token of Avalanche. Itâ€™s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to 
pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the
multiple Subnets created on Avalanche. `1 nAVAX` is equal to `0.000000001 AVAX`.

# AVAX

AVAX is a non-renewable resource (analogous to oil) that's used to power the Avalanche network.
AVAX is used for day-to-day operations in Avalanche such as staking and issuing transactions.

AVAX represents the weight that each node has in network decisions. No single actor owns 
the Avalanche Network, so each validator in the network is given a proportional weight in the 
network's decisions corresponding to the proportion of total stake that they own.

Any entity trying to execute a workload on Avalanche pays a corresponding fee (commonly known as 
"gas") to run it on the network. The gas used to execute a workload on Avalanche is removed from
existence (commonly known as "burning"). 

A small portion of burnt gas fees are used to reward validators at the end of their staking 
periods. Validators are rewarded for virtuous (e.g not attempting lie, steal, or otherwise
cause harm the Avalanche network) behavior by receiving validator rewards at the end of their
staking periods. Avalanche does not take away any portion of a validator's already staked tokens
(commonly known as "slashing") for negligent/malicious staking periods, however this behavior is
disincentivized as validators who attempt to do harm to the network would expend their node's
computing resources for no reward.
