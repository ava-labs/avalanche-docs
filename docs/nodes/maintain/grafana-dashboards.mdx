# Grafana Dashboards

These are pre-configured Grafana dashboards that work with the setup as shown in [Setting up node monitoring](setting-up-node-monitoring.md). The script in the linked tutorial will automatically install them.

To manually import preconfigured dashboards:

* Open Grafanaâ€™s web interface
* Click `+` on the left toolbar
* Select `Import JSON` and then upload the JSON file or paste the contents into `Import via panel json` area
* Select `Prometheus` as Data Source
