# What Is Staking?

Staking is the process where users lock up their tokens to support a blockchain network and, in return,
receive rewards. It is an essential part of proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms used by many 
blockchain networks, including Avalanche. PoS systems require participants to stake a certain amount
of tokens as collateral to participate in the network and validate transactions.

## How Does Proof-of-Stake Work?

To resist [sybil
attacks](https://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4064853-what-is-a-sybil-attack),
a decentralized network must require that network influence is paid with a
scarce resource. This makes it infeasibly expensive for an attacker to gain
enough influence over the network to compromise its security. On Avalanche, the scarce
resource is the native token,
[AVAX](/learn/avalanche/avax.md). For a node to validate
a blockchain on Avalanche, it must stake AVAX.
