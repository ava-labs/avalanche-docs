# How to extend Avalanche's subnet-evm with a stateful precompile

This tutorial will show you how to extend Avalanche's subnet-evm with custom functionality. It adds a novel stateful precompile contract to verify the X-Chain signature of a message that has been signed using the Avalanche Wallet or by other means.

Previously, we at [redÂ·dev](https://www.red.dev) wrote a [tutorial](https://docs.avax.network/community/tutorials-contest/red-dev-sig-verify-tutorial) on the same topic using solidity. But we think it is faster, more user-friendly, and more gas-efficient to recreate it as a stateful precompile that works similarly to ecrecover(), a precompile that is already built into subnet-evm that can verify C-Chain signatures.

In this tutorial, we describe each step of setting up the environment and adding the new stateful precompile. For more information, see the **Resources** section at the end of this tutorial.

## Audience

To get the most out of this tutorial, you will need to have a basic understanding of Avalanche, Linux, Go (a.k.a. GoLang), Solidity, and how to write dApps and use Remix. If you do not yet know about these topics, see the [**Resources**](#resources) section at the end for links to learn more.


## Important: Regarding the Example Code Included
In this tutorial you will find examples, and we have also included copies of the entire files that we have added or changed from subnet-evm in a folder called <i>example</i>. <b>Only use these files as a reference.</b> When making your own precompile, start with a current fork of subnet-evm and make your changes line-by-line to those preexisting files instead.

# Prerequisites

1. Ubuntu 20.04 or later
2. [Go 1.18.3](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz)
3. [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) set up for use with Local EVM subnet
4. User with _sudo_ access

## Install Go

Download the Go package. We have used version 1.18.3 for this tutorial:
```
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Extract go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz to /usr/local:
```
$ tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your $HOME/.profile or /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation):

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```
Verify that you've installed Go by running the command below:

```
$ go version
```
![go-v](ecrecover-x-chain-00-go-v.png)

Set `$GOPATH` environment variable properly for Go to look for Go Workspaces. Please read [this](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) for details. You can verify by running `echo $GOPATH`.

As some software will be installed into `$GOPATH/bin`, please make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`. Otherwise, you may get errors running the commands below.

## Clone Subnet-evm

Download the [`subnet-evm`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm.git) repository into your `$GOPATH`:

```sh
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/ava-labs
cd src/github.com/ava-labs
git clone git@github.com:ava-labs/subnet-evm.git
cd subnet-evm
```

This will clone and checkout to `master` branch.

## Add a Stateful Precompile

To add a novel stateful precompile into subnet-evm, follow these steps:

1. Modify the [precompile/params.go](./example/precompile/params.go) - which is used to define the designated address for the stateful precompiles.
2. Create your own custom precompile contract and place it under the precompile folder. In this tutorial we have created [contract_xchain_ecrecover.go](./example/precompile/contract_xchain_ecrecover.go).
3. Modify the [params/config.go](./example/params/config.go). This supports adding the chain configuration and managed the subnet-evm via the genesis.json file. Since, the precompiles is optional and can be added or removed from the subnet-evm at anytime which can be managed by the genesis.json file.
4. Modify the [scripts/run.sh](./example/scripts/run.sh) to include the custom precompile configuration.

### Modify the [example/precompile/params.go](./example/precompile/params.go) file

As we mentioned earlier, the [precompile/params.go](./example/precompile/params.go) is used to define the designated address for the stateful precompiles. The designated address should not be conflict with the any other precompile addresses. For forks of subnet-evm, users should start at 0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000 to ensure that their own modifications do not conflict with stateful precompiles that may be added to subnet-evm in the future.

We have taken the address `0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000` for this tutorial.

We have made changes below in the [params.go](./example/precompile/params.go) file at about [line 13](./example/precompile/params.go#L13) to declare the gas estimation value:

```diff
const (
	ModifyAllowListGasCost = 20_000
	ReadAllowListGasCost   = 5_000
	MintGasCost = 30_000
+	XChainECRecoverCost = 10_000
)
```

Next, at about [line 28](./example/precompile/params.go#L28) we have declared varaible ContractXchainECRecoverAddress and assign the designated contract address:

```diff
var (
	ContractDeployerAllowListAddress = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000")
	ContractNativeMinterAddress      = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001")
	TxAllowListAddress               = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002")
+   	ContractXchainECRecoverAddress   = common.HexToAddress("0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000")
	UsedAddresses = []common.Address{
		ContractDeployerAllowListAddress,
		ContractNativeMinterAddress,
		TxAllowListAddress,
+       	ContractXchainECRecoverAddress,
	}
)
```
### Create a new custom [contract_xchain_ecrecover.go](./example/precompile/contract_xchain_ecrecover.go) contract

We have created the precompile contract [contract_xchain_ecrecover.go](./example/precompile/contract_xchain_ecrecover.go). All stateful precompile contracts should implement the interfaces Address(), Contract(), Configure() and Timestamp().

The xChainECRecoverReadSignature contains the function selector which can be used in solidity smart contracts to execute the precompile.

The getXChainECRecover() function contains the business logic for verifying the signature and returning the X-Chain address.

Please [go take a look at it now](./example/precompile/contract_xchain_ecrecover.go).

(Please note that we are still working to repair one final defect in this example contract. After computing the correct X-Chain address of the signer, it does not yet return this value to the calling dApp due to an issue concerning data types. We expect to have this resolved soon.)

### Modify the [example/params/config.go](./example/params/config.go) file

As we mentioned earlier, the [example/params/config.go](./example/params/config.go) is used to add the chain configuration and managed the subnet-evm via the genesis.json file.

We have implemented the changes below in the [params.go](./example/precompile/params.go) file. At about [line 122](./example/params/config.go#L122) we have added the new custom contract `ContractXChainECRecoverConfig` in the ChainConfig struct with this we add or remove the precompiles through genesis.json file:

```diff
type ChainConfig struct {
	ChainID *big.Int `json:"chainId"` // chainId identifies the current chain and is used for replay protection
    .....
    .....
+   ContractXChainECRecoverConfig	precompile.ContractXChainECRecoverConfig   `json:"contractXChainECRecover,omitempty"` 		  // Config for the contract XChain ECrecover
}
```

Next, at about [line 563](./example/params/config.go#L563), we have included our custom precompiles intio the stateful precompiled configs:

```diff
func (c *ChainConfig) enabledStatefulPrecompiles() []precompile.StatefulPrecompileConfig {
	statefulPrecompileConfigs := make([]precompile.StatefulPrecompileConfig, 0)

	if c.ContractDeployerAllowListConfig.Timestamp() != nil {
		statefulPrecompileConfigs = append(statefulPrecompileConfigs, &c.ContractDeployerAllowListConfig)
	}
    	.....
    	.....
+   	if c.ContractXChainECRecoverConfig.Timestamp() != nil {
+ 		statefulPrecompileConfigs = append(statefulPrecompileConfigs, &c.ContractXChainECRecoverConfig)
+ 	}
}
```
Next, at about [line 496](./example/params/config.go#L496) we have introduced a boolean variable `IsContractXChainECRecoverEnabled` to enable mapping of the addresses to the stateful precompile:

```diff
type Rules struct {
	ChainID                                                 *big.Int
  	.....
  	.....

	// Optional stateful precompile rules
	IsContractDeployerAllowListEnabled bool
	IsContractNativeMinterEnabled      bool
	IsTxAllowListEnabled               bool
+ 	IsContractXChainECRecoverEnabled   bool

	// Precompiles maps addresses to stateful precompiled contracts that are enabled
	// for this rule set.
	// Note: none of these addresses should conflict with the address space used by
	// any existing precompiles.
	Precompiles map[common.Address]precompile.StatefulPrecompiledContract
}
```

Next, at about [line 533](./example/params/config.go#L533) we have set the enabled status of the `IsContractXChainECRecoverEnabled` by checking whether a fork scheduled at given block timestamp is active at the given head block:

```diff
func (c *ChainConfig) AvalancheRules(blockNum, blockTimestamp *big.Int) Rules {
  .....
  .....
  rules.IsContractDeployerAllowListEnabled = c.IsContractDeployerAllowList(blockTimestamp)
	rules.IsContractNativeMinterEnabled = c.IsContractNativeMinter(blockTimestamp)
	rules.IsTxAllowListEnabled = c.IsTxAllowList(blockTimestamp)
+ 	rules.IsContractXChainECRecoverEnabled = c.IsXChainECRecover(blockTimestamp)

	// Initialize the stateful precompiles that should be enabled at [blockTimestamp].
	rules.Precompiles = make(map[common.Address]precompile.StatefulPrecompiledContract)
    .....

	return rules
}
```

Next, at about [line 261](./example/params/config.go#L261) we created a function to return the fork enabled status based on block timestamp:

```diff
func (c *ChainConfig) IsTxAllowList(blockTimestamp *big.Int) bool {
	return utils.IsForked(c.TxAllowListConfig.Timestamp(), blockTimestamp)
}
+ func (c *ChainConfig) IsXChainECRecover(blockTimestamp *big.Int) bool {
+	  return utils.IsForked(c.ContractXChainECRecoverConfig.Timestamp(), blockTimestamp)
+ }
```

### Modify [scripts/run.sh](./example/scripts/run.sh)

The [scripts/run.sh](./example/scripts/run.sh) by default includes the default configuration. Since, the precompiles created under precompile folder are optional and can be added to the subnet-evm by configuring in the genesis.json file.

We have to modify the default genesis.json setting in the [scripts/run.sh](./example/scripts/run.sh) to enable our custom precompile. At about [line 125](./example/scripts/run.sh#L125) under config object we have added the configuration for custom precompile. The configuration name `contractXChainECRecover` can be derived from [params/config.go line 122](./example/params/config.go#L122):

```diff
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": $CHAIN_ID,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    .....
    .....
    "feeConfig": {
      "gasLimit": 20000000,
      .....
      .....
      "blockGasCostStep": 500000
    },
+     "contractXChainECRecover": {
+       "blockTimestamp": 0
+     }
  },
  "alloc": {
    "${GENESIS_ADDRESS:2}": {
      "balance": "0x52B7D2DCC80CD2E4000000"
    }
  },
  "nonce": "0x0",
  ....
  ....

}
```

## Run the Local Subnet-evm

The final step is to run the local subnet-evm.

[`scripts/run.sh`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/scripts/run.sh) automatically installs `avalanchego`, sets up a local network,
and creates a `subnet-evm` genesis file. The usage of this script is

```bash
./scripts/run.sh [AVALANCHEGO VERSION] [GENESIS_ADDRESS]
```


```bash
# to startup a local cluster (good for development)
cd ${HOME}/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm
./scripts/run.sh 1.7.13 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
```

Note that this address (`0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`) is a prefunded address on the local network, see [here](https://docs.avax.network/quickstart/fund-a-local-test-network) for more info. The private key for this address is
`0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027`.

With this command, `avalanchego`, `avalanche-network-runner` and GoLang packages will be downloaded and installed on a `/tmp` directory. Note: please make sure that your have fast internet connection to download these packages, otherwise, it will take a long time.

Once the the network is started up, the following info will be printed to the
console:

```bash
cluster is ready!

## Using the Precompile from Remix

You can copy paste the Solidity interface [contract_xchain_ecrecover.sol](./example/precompile/contract_xchain_ecrecover.sol) into Remix and compile it by hitting âCompile contract_xchain_ecrecover.solâ.

Once youâve compiled the interface, you can navigate to the Deploy tab in remix, select âInjected Web3â for your local environment so that you can interact with your EVM instance, and paste the address 0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000 of the precompile in the field to the right of âAt Addressâ.

Clicking âAt Addressâ will deploy the interface at that address, as if you had deployed a fully implemented contract in Solidity and from there you can interact with the precompile directly in Solidity.

As input to the getXChainECRecover() function, pass prefixed hashed message, r, s and v from the signature as arguments. The function will return the X-chain address which signed the message.

### Extraction tool
For your convenience, we have created a simple tool to make it easy to extract the prefixed hashed message and the r, s, and v values required by this function: [Avalanche Wallet Signature Extraction Tool](https://rediyeti.com/avax-sig-extraction-tool)

# Conclusion
The ability to add stateful precompiles to an Avalanche subnet based on subnet-evm opens up a world of possibilities. We chose to write a precompile to address one significant use-case pertaining to subnet inter-communication, the ability to verify signatures signed with Avalanche X-Chain addresses, but the possibilities are endless. In any case, no matter what particular precompile you chose to write, you can follow the steps in this tutorial to integrate it into your fork of the subnet-evm.
