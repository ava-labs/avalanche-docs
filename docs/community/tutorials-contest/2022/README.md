# Winners of the 2022 Subnet Tutorial Contest

Recently, Avalanche called for developers to rise to an occasion: [a contest](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-launches-subnet-tutorial-contest-with-32k-in-prizes-e8c81c731f2a) for the best tutorials explaining to other devs how to launch Avalanche Subnets. Subnets are, of course, Avalanche’s means of [scaling infinitely](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/its-time-infinitely-scale-with-subnets-ab7cc91efa7f). Anyone was able to submit a written tutorial, with selected tutorials eligible to win some of the cool $32,000 prize pool.
