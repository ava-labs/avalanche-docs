# ðŸ”Œ RPC Providers

There are multiple RPC providers from which you can choose from. These providers will work as
intermediaries to help you interact with the Avalanche network. You'll experience different latency
levels depending on the provider's configurations. You can potentially use multiple providers for
redundancy and balancing.

## Mainnet RPC - Public API Server

There is a public API server that allows developers to access the Avalanche
network without having to run a node themselves. The public API server is
actually several [AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) nodes
behind a load balancer to ensure high availability and high request throughput.

### Using the Public API Nodes

The public API server is at `api.avax.network` for Avalanche Mainnet and
`api.avax-test.network` for Avalanche Fuji Testnet. To access a particular API,
just append the relevant API endpoint, as documented
[here](/reference/standards/guides/issuing-api-calls.md). Namely, use the following end points for
each chain respectively:

#### HTTP

- For C-Chain API, the URL is `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`.
- For X-Chain API, the URL is `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/X`.
- For P-Chain API, the URL is `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/P`.

Note: on Fuji Testnet, use `https://api.avax-test.network/` instead of `https://api.avax.network/`.

#### WebSocket

- For C-Chain API, the URL is `wss://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/ws`.

Note: on Fuji Testnet, the URL is `wss://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/ws`.

#### Supported APIs

The public API server supports all the API endpoints that make sense to be
available on a public-facing service, including APIs for the
[X-Chain](/reference/avalanchego/x-chain/api.md), [P-Chain](/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api.md),
[C-Chain](/reference/avalanchego/c-chain/api.md), and full archival for the Primary Network.
However, it doesn't support [Index APIs](/reference/avalanchego/index-api.md), which includes
the X-Chain API's `getAddressTxs` method.

For a full list of available APIs see [here](/reference).

#### Limitations

The public API only supports C-Chain WebSocket API calls for API methods that
don't exist on the C-Chain's HTTP API.

For batched C-Chain requests on the public API node, the maximum number of items
is 40. We're working on to support a larger batch size.

The maximum number of blocks to serve per `getLogs` request is 2048, which is set by [`api-max-blocks-per-request`](/nodes/configure/chain-configs/C.md#api-max-blocks-per-request).

#### Sticky Sessions

Requests to the public API server API are distributed by a load balancer to an
individual node. As a result, consecutive requests may go to different nodes.
That can cause issues for some use cases. For example, one node may think a
given transaction is accepted, while for another node the transaction is still
processing. To work around this, you can use 'sticky sessions', as documented
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials).
This allows consecutive API calls to be routed to the same node.

If you're using [AvalancheJS](/tooling/avalanchejs-overview.md) to access the public
API, simply set the following in your code:

```javascript
avalanche.setRequestConfig("withCredentials", true);
```

#### Availability

Usage of public API nodes is free and available to everyone without any
authentication or authorization. Rate limiting is present, but many of the API
calls are cached, and the rate limits are quite high. If your app is
running up against the limits, please [contact us](https://chat.avalabs.org) or
try using a community RPC provider.

If you have questions, problems, or suggestions, join the official [Avalanche Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org/).
