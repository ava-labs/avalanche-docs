# Deploy a Permissioned Subnet on Mainnet

:::warning

Deploying a Subnet to Mainnet has many risks. Doing so safely requires a laser focus on security.
This tutorial does its best to point out common pitfalls, but there may be other risks not discussed
here.

This tutorial is an educational resource and provides no guarantees that following it results in a
secure deployment. Additionally, this tutorial takes some shortcuts that aid the understanding of
the deployment process at the expense of security. The text highlights these shortcuts and they
shouldn't be used for a production deployment.

:::

After managing a successful Subnet deployment on the `Fuji Testnet`, you're ready to deploy your
Subnet on Mainnet. If you haven't done so, first
[Deploy a Subnet on Testnet](/build/subnet/deploy/fuji-testnet-subnet.md).

This tutorial shows how to do the following on `Mainnet`.

- Create a Subnet.
- Deploy a virtual machine based on Subnet-EVM.
- Join a node to the newly created Subnet.
- Add a node as a validator to the Subnet.

:::note

All IDs in this article are for illustration purposes only. They are guaranteed to be different in
your own run-through of this tutorial.

:::

## Prerequisites

- 5+ nodes running and [fully bootstrapped](/nodes/README.md) on `Mainnet`
- [Avalanche-CLI is installed](/tooling/cli-guides/install-avalanche-cli.md) on each validator node's
  box
- A [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) device
- You've [created a Subnet configuration](/build/subnet/hello-subnet.md#create-your-subnet-configuration)
  and fully tested a [Fuji Testnet Subnet deployment](/build/subnet/deploy/fuji-testnet-subnet.md)

:::warning

Although only one validator is strictly required to run a Subnet, running with less than five
validators is extremely dangerous and guarantees network downtime. Plan to support at least five
validators in your production network.

:::

### Getting Your Mainnet NodeIDs

You need to collect the NodeIDs for each of your validators. This tutorial uses these NodeIDs in
several commands.

To get the NodeID of a `Mainnet` node, call the
[info.getNodeID](/reference/avalanchego/info-api.md#infogetnodeid) endpoint. For example:

```text
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

The response should look something like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "nodeID": "NodeID-5mb46qkSBj81k9g9e4VFjGGSbaaSLFRzD"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

In the sample response, `NodeID-5mb46qkSBj81k9g9e4VFjGGSbaaSLFRzD` is the NodeID. Note that the
`NodeID-` prefix is part of the NodeID.

### Setting up Your Ledger

In the interest of security, all Avalanche-CLI `Mainnet` operations require the use of a connected
Ledger device. You must unlock your Ledger and run the Avalanche App. See [How to Use
Ledger](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6150237-how-to-use-a-ledger-nano-s-or-nano-x-with-avalanche)
for help getting set up.

Avalanche-CLI supports the Ledger `Nano X`, `Nano S`, and `Nano S Plus`.

Ledger devices support TX signing for any address inside a sequence automatically generated by the device.

By default, Avalanche-CLI uses the first address of the derivation, and that address needs funds to
issue the TXs to create the Subnet and add validators.

To get the first `Mainnet` address of your Ledger device, first make sure it is connected,
unblocked, and running the Avalanche app. Then execute the `key list` command:

```bash
avalanche key list --ledger 0 --mainnet
```

```text
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
|  KIND  |  NAME   |          CHAIN          |                    ADDRESS                    | BALANCE | NETWORK |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
| ledger | index 0 | P-Chain (Bech32 format) | P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j |      11 | Mainnet |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
```

The command prints the P-Chain address for `Mainnet`,
`P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j`, and its balance. You should fund this address with
at least 2.5 AVAX to cover TX fees. the TX fee for creating your Subnet costs 2 AVAX. Adding
validators costs 0.001 AVAX each. For more details, see [Fees](/reference/standards/guides/txn-fees)

:::note

You can use the `key list` command to get any Ledger address in the derivation sequence by
changing the index parameter from `0` to the one desired, or to a list of them (for example: `2`, or
`0,4,7`). Also, you can ask for addresses on `Fuji` with the `--fuji` parameter, and local networks
with the `--local` parameter.

:::

#### Funding the Ledger

A new Ledger device has no funds on the addresses it controls. You'll need to send funds to it by
exporting them from C-Chain to the P-Chain using [Core web](https://core.app)
connected to [Core extension](https://join.core.app/extension).

You can load the Ledger's C-Chain address in Core extension, or load in a different private key to 
[Core extension](https://join.core.app/extension), and then connect to Core web . 

You can move test funds from the C-Chain to the P-Chain by clicking Stake on Core web , then Cross-Chain Transfer (find more details on
[this tutorial](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/8133713-core-web-how-do-i-make-cross-chain-transfers-in-core-stake)).

## Deploy the Subnet

With your Ledger unlocked and running the Avalanche app, run

```bash
avalanche subnet deploy testsubnet
```

This is going to start a new prompt series.

```text
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to deploy on:
    Local Network
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

This tutorial is about deploying to `Mainnet`, so navigate with the arrow keys to `Mainnet` and hit enter.

```text
✔ Mainnet
Deploying [testsubnet] to Mainnet
```

After that, CLI shows the `Mainnet` Ledger address used to fund the deployment:

```text
Ledger address: P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

The deployment requires running a [createSubnet transaction](/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api.md#platformcreatesubnet)
and a [createBlockchain transaction](/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api.md#platformcreateblockchain),
and so this first Ledger address must have the funds to issue both operations.

This tutorial creates a permissioned Subnet. As such, you must specify which P-Chain addresses can
control the Subnet. These addresses are known as `Control Keys`. The CLI can automatically set your
Ledger's address as the sole control key or the user may specify a custom list.

:::warning

In production Subnets, you should always use multiple control keys running in a multisig
configuration. This tutorial uses a single control key for illustrative purposes only.

For instructions on controlling your Subnet with a multisig, see the [Multisig Deployment Tutorial](/build/subnet/deploy/multisig-auth.md).

:::

```text
Configure which addresses may make changes to the subnet.
These addresses are known as your control keys. You are going to also
set how many control keys are required to make a subnet change (the threshold).
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? How would you like to set your control keys?:
  ▸ Use ledger address
    Custom list
```

For this tutorial, opt to use the first Ledger address, so enter at `Use ledger address`. Only
this address is going to be able to add or remove validators, or create blockchains on the Subnet.

```text
Your Subnet's control keys: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
Your subnet auth keys for chain creation: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
```

Next, the CLI generates a TX for creating the SubnetID and asks the user to sign it by using the Ledger.

```text
*** Please sign subnet creation hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by
using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

If the Ledger doesn't have enough funds, the user may see an error message:

```text
*** Please sign subnet creation hash on the ledger device ***
Error: insufficient funds: provided UTXOs need 1000000000 more units of asset "U8iRqJoiJm8xZHAacmvYyZVwqQx6uDNtQeP3CQ6fcgQk3JqnK"
```

If successful, the CLI next asks you to sign a chain creation TX.

```text
Subnet has been created with ID: 2UUCLbdGqawRDND7kHjwq3zXXMPdiycG2bkyuRzYMnuTSDr6db. Now creating blockchain...
*** Please sign blockchain creation hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by
using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

After that, CLI creates the blockchain within the Subnet, and a summary window for the deployment
appears:

```text

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Well done. You have just created your own Subnet running on `Mainnet`. Now it's time to add your validators.

## Request to Join a Subnet as a Validator

The new Subnet created in the previous steps doesn't have any dedicated validators yet.
To request permission to validate a Subnet, the following steps are required:

:::info

Adding a validator on a Subnet requires that the node is already a validator on the primary network,
which means that your node has **fully bootstrapped**.

See [here](/nodes/validate/add-a-validator.md#add-a-validator-with-avalanche-wallet) on how to become
a validator.

:::

First, request permission to validate by running the `join` command along with the Subnet name:

```bash
avalanche subnet join testsubnet
```

Note: Running `join` does not guarantee that your node is a validator of the Subnet! The owner of
the Subnet must approve your node to be a validator afterwards by calling `addValidator` as
described in the next section.

### Select Mainnet

When you `join` command, you are first prompted with the network selection. Choose `Mainnet`:

```text
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to validate on (this command only supports public networks):
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

### Setup Node Automatically

There are now two choices possible: automatic and Manual configuration. As mentioned earlier,
"Automatic" attempts to edit your config file and sets up your plugin directory, while "Manual" just
prints the required config to the screen. If you are running the CLI on the same box as your
validator, you should run the commands in automated mode. If you don't want to run Avalanche-CLI
on the same box as your validator, use the manual commands.

Select automatic.

#### Set Config File

```text
✔ Automatic
✔ Path to your existing config file (or where it's going to be generated): config.json
```

Provide a path to a config file. If this command runs on the box where your validator is running,
then you could point this to the actually used config file, for example
`/etc/avalanchego/config.json` - just make sure the tool has **write** access to the file. Or you could
just copy the file later. In any case, the tool is going to either try to edit the existing file specified
by the given path, or create a new file. Again, set write permissions.

#### Set Plugin Directory

Next, provide the plugin directory. Each VM runs its own binary, called a plugin. Therefore, you
need to copy your VM's plugin binary into AvalancheGo's plugin directory. This directory depends
on your AvalancheGo install location.

```text
✔ Path to your avalanchego plugin dir (likely avalanchego/build/plugins): /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins
```

The tool doesn't know where exactly it's located so it requires the full path. With the path given,
it's going to copy the VM binary to the provided location:

```text
✔ Path to your avalanchego plugin dir (likely avalanchego/build/plugins): /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins█
VM binary written to /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins/tGBrMADESojmu5Et9CpbGCrmVf9fiAJtZM5ZJ3YVDj5JTu2qw
This is going to edit your existing config file. This edit is nondestructive,
but it's always good to have a backup.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Proceed?:
  ▸ Yes
    No
```

Hitting `Yes` writes the necessary file:

```text
✔ Yes
The config file has been edited. To use it, make sure to start the node with the '--config-file'
option, e.g.

./build/avalanchego --config-file config.json

(using your binary location). The node has to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
```

#### Restart the Node

It's **required to restart the node**.

### Setup Node Manually

By choosing "Manual" instead, the tool prints _instructions_. The user is going to have to follow
these instructions and apply them to the node. Note that the IDs for the VM and Subnet are different
for each Subnet deployment and you shouldn't copy them from this tutorial.

```text
✔ Manual

To setup your node, you must do two things:

1. Add your VM binary to your node's plugin directory
2. Update your node config to start validating the subnet

To add the VM to your plugin directory, copy or scp from /tmp/tGBrMADESojmu5Et9CpbGCrmVf9fiAJtZM5ZJ3YVDj5JTu2qw

If you installed avalanchego manually, your plugin directory is likely
avalanchego/build/plugins.

If you start your node from the command line WITHOUT a config file (e.g. via command
line or systemd script), add the following flag to your node's startup command:

--track-subnets=2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H
(if the node already has a track-subnets config, append the new value by
comma-separating it).

For example:
./build/avalanchego --network-id=Mainnet --track-subnets=2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H

If you start the node via a JSON config file, add this to your config file:
track-subnets: 2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H

TIP: Try this command with the --avalanchego-config flag pointing to your config file,
this tool is going to try to update the file automatically (make sure it can write to it).

After you update your config, you are going to need to restart your node for the changes to
take effect.
```

## Add a Validator

:::warning

If the `join` command isn't successfully completed before `addValidator` is completed, the Subnet
could experience degraded performance or even halt.

:::

Now that the node has joined the Subnet, a Subnet control key holder must call `addValidator` to
grant the node permission to be a validator in your Subnet.

To whitelist a node as a recognized validator on the Subnet, run:

```bash
avalanche subnet addValidator testsubnet
```

You need to repeat this process for every validator you add to the network.

You can run the `addValidator` transactions from the same box that deployed the Subnet.

### Submit addValidator TX to Mainnet

First choose `Mainnet` as the network to add the Subnet validator to.

```text
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to add validator to.:
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

Because this operation issues a new
[transaction](/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api.md#platformaddsubnetvalidator), the CLI needs the
control keys to sign the operation. Because this tutorial only uses one control key in the Subnet,
the process looks slightly different if you use multiple controls keys. The address needs to pay a
TX fee of 0.001 AVAX.

```text
Your subnet auth keys for add validator tx creation: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
```

### Set NodeID

Now enter the [**NodeID**](#getting-your-mainnet-nodeids) of the validator.

```text
Next, we need the NodeID of the validator you want to whitelist.

Check https://docs.avax.network/apis/avalanchego/apis/info#infogetnodeid for instructions about how
to query the NodeID from your node
(Edit host IP address and port to match your deployment, if needed).
✔ What is the NodeID of the validator you'd like to whitelist?: NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg█
```

Note, this ID is intentionally modified to prevent replication.

### Set Stake Weight

Select 30 as the stake weight. You can learn more about the stake weight parameter in
[addSubnetValidator](/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api.md#platformaddsubnetvalidator) under the
`weight` section.

:::warning

The stake weight of all your validators should sum to at least 100.

:::

```text
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? What stake weight would you like to assign to the validator?:
    Default (20)
  ▸ Custom
```

```text
✔ What stake weight would you like to assign to the validator?: 30
```

### Set Validation Start Time

Next, specify when the validator is going to start validating. The time must be in the future. You
can use the custom option to enter a specific date in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. Follow the
default this time:

```text
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Start time:
  ▸ Start in one minute
    Custom
```

### Set Validation duration

Finally, specify how long it's going to be validating:

```text
✔ Start in one minute
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? How long should your validator validate for?:
  ▸ Until primary network validator expires
    Custom
```

If you choose `Custom` here, you need to enter a **duration**, which is a time span expressed in hours.
For example, say `200 days = 24 \* 200 = 4800h`

```text
✔ How long should this validator be validating? Enter a duration, e.g. 8760h: 4800h
```

The CLI shows the user an actual date:

```text
? Your validator is going to finish staking by 2023-06-10 13:07:58:
  ▸ Yes
    No
```

Confirm if correct.

### Issue the TX

At this point the prompt series is complete and the CLI attempts the transaction:

```text
NodeID: NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg
Network: Mainnet
Start time: 2022-11-22 13:07:58
End time: 2023-06-10 13:07:58
Weight: 30
Inputs complete, issuing transaction to add the provided validator information...
```

The CLI shows the Ledger address:

```text
Ledger address: P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

At this point, if the Ledger address isn't the control key for the Subnet, the user receives
an error:

```text
Error: wallet doesn't contain subnet auth keys
exit status 1
```

If the Ledger doesn't have enough funds, the following error message appears:

```text
*** Please sign subnet creation hash on the ledger device ***
Error: insufficient funds: provided UTXOs need 1000000 more units of asset "U8iRqJoiJm8xZHAacmvYyZVwqQx6uDNtQeP3CQ6fcgQk3JqnK"
```

Otherwise, both the CLI and the Ledger request to sign the TX:

```text
*** Please sign add validator hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by
using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and
right buttons.

This might take a couple of seconds. After, it prints:

```text
Transaction successful, transaction ID: r3tJ4Wr2CWA8AaticmFrKdKgAs5AhW2wwWTaQHRBZKwJhsXzb
```

This means the node is now a validator on the given Subnet on `Mainnet`! However, your work isn't
complete. You **must** finish the [Request to Join a Subnet as a Validator](#request-to-join-a-subnet-as-a-validator)
section otherwise your Subnet risks downtime.

You can get the P-Chain TX id information on [Avalanche Explorer](https://subnets.avax.network/)

## Subnet Export

Because you need to setup multiple validators on multiple different machines, you need to export
your Subnet's configuration and import it on each validator.

```bash
avalanche subnet export testsubnet
✔ Enter file path to write export data to: /tmp/testsubnet-export.dat
```

The file is in text format and you shouldn't change it. You can use it to import the configuration
on a different machine.

## Subnet Import

To import a VM configuration, move the file you exported in the previous section to your desired
machine and issue the `import` command with the path to the file.

```bash
avalanche subnet import /tmp/testsubnet-export.dat
Subnet imported successfully
```

After this the whole Subnet configuration should be available on the target machine:

```text
avalanche subnet list
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
|    SUBNET     |     CHAIN     | CHAIN ID |   TYPE    | DEPLOYED |
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
| testsubnet    | testsubnet    |     3333 | SubnetEVM | No       |
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
```

## Going Live

Once all of your validators have joined the network, you are ready to issue transactions to your Subnet.

For the safety of your validators, you should setup dedicated API nodes to process transactions, but
for test purposes, you can issue transactions directly to one of your validator's RPC interface.
