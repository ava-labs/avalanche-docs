## Introduction

In this tutorial you will get familiar with [ERC721
(NFT)](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/the-anatomy-of-erc721-e9db77abfc24)
smart contracts and how to deploy these to the [Avalanche Fuji
testnet](/build/dapp/fuji-workflow.md) and
also the [Avalanche Mainnet
(C-Chain)](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform#c-chain).
The goal of this tutorial is to be as beginner friendly as possible. I will go
through each line of code in order to give you a full understanding of what is
happening, so that you can use the concepts as a basis for your first NFT
decentralized application. The plan is to showcase:

1. How to create an ERC721 smart contract, so that you can mint your own ERC721
   NFT on Avalanche using [Open
   Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) and the
   [Truffle framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview);
2. How to extend the contract, so that each token has royalties;
3. How to create your own NFT marketplace where you can list your items, cancel
   listings and purchase other NFTs;
4. How to extensively test your smart contracts using Truffle's built in
   Mocha.js library and Open Zeppelin's Test Helper assertion library achieving
   100% code coverage;
5. How to deploy your smart contracts on the Avalanche Fuji testnet and on the
   Avalanche Mainnet;

## Development

For this tutorial I have used [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my code editor of choice but you can
used any code editor you like. I recommend to install the **solidity** extension
by Juan Blanco to get that nice Syntax highlighting along with some code
snippets should you go for Visual Studio Code. You would also need to create a
MetaMask wallet or whatever similar provider you are comfortable with in order
to deploy to the networks.

### Dependencies

- [NodeJS v8.9.4 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Truffle, which you can install with npm install -g truffle
- (Optional) [Avalanche Network
  Runner](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-network-runner) is a tool for
  running a local Avalanche network.

### Setting Up a Truffle Project

1. Create a project directory and inside of it run the commands:

    ```powershell
    truffle init -y
    npm init -y
    ```

2. The first one will provide you with a base structure of a Truffle project and
the second one will include a **package.json** file to keep track of the
dependencies. Afterwards, include the following dependencies which will help us
build and test the smart contracts.

    ```powershell
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @truffle/hdwallet-provider dotenv typescript typechain truffle-typings ts-node 
    npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/test-helpers solidity-coverage
    ```

    - The
      [@openzeppelin/contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
      is a library for a secure smart contract development. We inherit from their
      ERC721 smart contract;
    - The
      [@truffle/hdwallet-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/hdwallet-provider)
      is used to sign transactions for addresses derived from a 12 or 24 word
      mnemonic. In our case we will create a MetaMask wallet and provide the
      mnemonic from there to deploy to the Avalanche Fuji testnet;
    - The [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is a zero-dependency module
      that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. We do not
      want to leak our mnemonic to other people after all;
    - The [typechain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typechain) allows us to use
      TypeScript within Truffle;
    - The [truffle-typings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-typings) is a
      library that goes with TypeChain should you want to use TypeScript for your
      Truffle environment;
    - The [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) is a package which we
      would need for a TypeScript execution of our scripts in Node.js;
    - The
      [@openzeppelin/test-helpers](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/0.5/)
      is a library that will helps us test when transactions revert and also handle
      Big Numbers for us. It is a dev dependency;
    - The [solidity-coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage) is a
      library that we will use to check how much coverage our tests have. It is
      again a dev dependency;

3. Now that we have all the necessary dependencies installed, let us go to the
   **truffle-config.js** in the root of our project and paste the following
   lines of code in there:

    ```JavaScript
    //we need this to be able to run our .ts tests
    require('ts-node/register')

    const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider')
    require('dotenv').config()
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        fuji: {
          provider: () => {
            return new HDWalletProvider({
              mnemonic: process.env.MNEMONIC,
              providerOrUrl: `https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/${process.env.APIKEY}/ext/bc/C/rpc`,
              chainId: '43113'
            })
          },
          network_id: "*",
          gasPrice: 225000000000
        },
        mainnet: {
          provider: () => {
            return new HDWalletProvider({
              mnemonic: process.env.MNEMONIC,
              providerOrUrl: `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`,
              chainId: '43114',
            })
          },
          network_id: "*",
          gasPrice: 225000000000
        }
      },
      compilers: {
        solc: {
          version: "0.8.6"
        }
      },
      plugins: ["solidity-coverage"],
      test_file_extension_regexp: /.*\.ts$/
    }
    ```

    This file is the entrypoint of our Truffle project. As you can see, we specify
    two networks on which we would like to deploy our smart contracts after we are
    done with them, namely *Fuji* and *Mainnet*. We utilize the
    [@truffle/hdwallet-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/hdwallet-provider)
    library, so that we provide a RPC to which we can connect to in order to deploy our
    contracts as well as a mnemonic which will be used to sign the transaction to do
    that. As you can see, some of the variables are accessed via process.env. These
    are defined in a separate **.env** file in the root of our project and have the
    following structure:

    ```sh
    MNEMONIC='paste your metamask mnemonic here which is twelve words long believe me'
    APIKEY=YOUR_DATAHUB_API_KEY_FOR_THE_FUJI_TESTNET
    ```

    Note: For the Fuji testnet I used [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/signup)'s
    testnet RPC. There is a free plan which you can use. For that you would need to
    register, grab your APIKEY and paste it into your **.env** file. Complete
    DataHub onboarding guide to DataHub 2.0 can be found
    [HERE](https://docs.figment.io/guides/getting-started-with-datahub)

4. We would also need two more configuration files in order to build our initial
   TypeScript environment. Let us create a **tsconfig.json** under the root of
   our project with the following contents:

    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "es2017",
            "module": "commonjs",
            "strict": true,
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "noImplicitThis": true,
            "noImplicitAny": false,
            "alwaysStrict": true,
            "experimentalDecorators": true,
            "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
            "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
            "lib": [
                "es2015"
            ],
            "sourceMap": true,
            "types": [
                "node",
                "truffle-typings"
            ]
        },
        "include": [
            "**/*.ts"
        ],
        "exclude": [
            "node_modules",
            "build"
        ]
    }
    ```

    As well as a **tsconfig.migrate.json** again under the root folder of our project:

    ```json
    {
        "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
        "include": [
            "./migrations/*.ts"
        ]
    }
    ```

    This file simply extends our base **tsconfig.json** by taking the folder
    **migrations/** contents into account. We will go through migrating in more
    detail after we have finished implementing and testing our contracts.

5. Add `generate` script in your **package.json**:

```json
"scripts": {
    "generate": "typechain --target=truffle-v5 'build/contracts/*.json'"
}
```

Whenever you make changes to your smart contract you would need to run `npm run generate`.

### Writing Our First ERC721 Contract

1. Inside the **contracts/** folder of your Truffle project we will create a new
   [**Collectible.sol**](./contracts/Collectible.sol) file and implement the
   functions we need. Now that we have this, let us start from the top and
   explain what the smart contract does.

2. [**Collectible.sol**](./contracts/Collectible.sol) logic

- At the top we define the [Solidity version
  0.8.6](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/) which at the time of this
  tutorial is the latest one:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.6;
```

- Next we import the
  [**ERC721URIStorage.sol**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol)
  contract from Open Zeppelin. This contract is an extension of their
  [**ERC721.sol**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol)
  contract which takes metadata of an NFT into account as well. We will also use
  the popular
  [**SafeMath.sol**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol)
  library for our mathematical operations. This is a library which prevents
  unsigned integer overflows:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
```

- Now that we have done that let us define our **Collectible** contract which
  will inherit from the **ERC721URIStorage**. This would allow us to use all the
  functions and access all the public state variables which that contract
  offers. Pretty cool, right?

```solidity
contract Collectible is ERC721URIStorage {
```

- Afterwards we will define the state variables and also the constructor of our contract:

```solidity
    mapping(string => bool) public hasBeenMinted;
    mapping(uint256 => Item) public tokenIdToItem;
    struct Item {
        address owner;
        address creator;
        uint256 royalty;
    }
    Item[] private items;
    event ItemMinted(uint256 tokenId, address creator, string metadata, uint256 royalty);
    
    constructor() ERC721("NFTCollectible", "NFTC") {}
```

The main thing to note here is the **Item** struct. We need one to keep track of
some extra on-chain data that our NFTs can have. In our case this is the
**owner**, the **creator** and the **royalty** which would be a percentage of
the price paid out to the **creator** on each purchase of the NFT. With each
minting, a new **Item** will be pushed to the array of items. This array can be
then used to display those properties on the frontend, for example. We define an
**ItemMinted** event due to our custom NFTs which we will emit at the end of our
minting function. Last but not least, as you can see, we initialize the ERC721
constructor by providing it a name for our token contract and a symbol. These
are the two parameters which it takes. Our constructor does not have any, hence
the empty body. The mappings are used to keep track of information such as
whether a metadata hash has been minted, meaning that we prevent the minting of
that metadata again and also to map the token id to an **Item**.

- The **createCollectible(string memory metadata, uint256 royalty)** function:

```solidity
function createCollectible(string memory metadata, uint256 royalty) public returns (uint256)
    {
        require(
            !hasBeenMinted[metadata],
            "This metadata has already been used to mint an NFT."
        );
        require(
            royalty >= 0 && royalty <= 40,
            "Royalties must be between 0% and 40%"
        );
        Item memory newItem = Item(msg.sender, msg.sender, royalty);
        items.push(newItem);
        uint256 newItemId = items.length;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, metadata);
        tokenIdToItem[newItemId] = newItem;
        hasBeenMinted[metadata] = true;
        emit ItemMinted(newItemId, msg.sender, metadata, royalty);
        return newItemId;
    }
```

The function takes two parameters - metadata and royalty. In the beginning of
the function body we see a couple of guard conditions which are used to prevent
unwanted transaction execution and to revert the transaction if the conditions
are not fulfilled. We use the mapping which we have defined above to check
whether the metadata has been minted. We also check whether the royalty is
between 0% and 40%. Should we pass these conditions, we can now move on to
creating our **Item** with the information we have. At this point the creator is
both the owner and the creator, so we use **msg.sender** which is one of
Solidity's global variables and denotes the caller of the function. Our third
property is the royalty. After we push this **Item** to the array, we make use
of the functions which the
[**ERC721URIStorage.sol**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol)
provides us, namely:

```solidity
_safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);
_setTokenURI(newItemId, metadata);
```

This will do the minting for us and associate the item id (token id) with the
metadata which we have provided. At the end we update the mappings accordingly
with the new information and return the token id.

- Furthermore, we define a couple of view functions. These do not cost any gas,
  since we do not change the state of the blockchain by calling them. In the
  second function you can notice that in the **returns** part we do not have
  **Item**, but rather the properties of the **Item**. Solidity allows returning
  multiple values.

```solidity
    function getItemsLength() public view returns (uint256) {
        return items.length;
    }
    
    function getItem(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address, address, uint256)
    {
        return (tokenIdToItem[tokenId].owner, tokenIdToItem[tokenId].creator, tokenIdToItem[tokenId].royalty);
    }
}
```

### Creating Our NFT Marketplace.sol Contract

1. Inside the **contracts/** folder, we create a new
[**Marketplace.sol**](./contracts/Marketplace.sol) file again with the necessary
functionality. This might look slightly more complicated but once again, I will
go through each line of code, so that at the end you can make sense of the logic
entirely.

2. [**Marketplace.sol**](./contracts/Marketplace.sol) logic

- At the top we define as usual the solidity version:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.6;
```

- Next we will import our already created
  [**Collectible.sol**](./contracts/Collectible.sol) contract and inherit from
  it, since we would want to make use of some of the public state variables
  there:

```solidity
import './Collectible.sol';

contract Marketplace is Collectible {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
```

Note: You might have noticed that we again use **SafeMath** for the uint256.
This is to prevent the overflows that might happen.

- Afterwards we will define the state variables, events and modifiers:

```solidity
    struct Listing {
        uint256 price;
        address owner;
    }
    mapping (uint256 => Listing) public tokenIdToListing;
    mapping (uint256 => bool) public hasBeenListed;
    mapping (uint256 => address) public claimableByAccount;
    event ItemListed(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price, address seller);
    event ListingCancelled(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price, address seller);
    event ItemBought(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price, address buyer);

    modifier onlyTokenOwner(uint256 tokenId) {
        require(
            msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId),
            "Only the owner of the token id can call this function."
        );
        _;
    }

    modifier onlyListingAccount(uint256 tokenId) {
        require(
            msg.sender == claimableByAccount[tokenId],
            "Only the address that has listed the token can cancel the listing."
        );
        _;
    }
```

You can see that again we have a struct for the **Listing** of a NFT. We use it
to define who has listed a NFT and for what price. We have again some mappings
to keep track of vital information such as to which token id a listing belongs
to, whether the token id has been listed, as we do not want any double listings
of the same NFT and also we have a mapping to keep track of the address that can
claim the NFT after it has been listed. This is of course the owner of the item.
We need this, because you will see in a bit that we transfer the NFT to the
smart contract when listing it, thus making the smart contract the new owner. We
have some events for the different functions, namely for listing, cancelling a
listing and buying an item. The new concepts which you see here are the
modifiers. These can be appended as function modifiers to the functions and act
exactly the same as the require() statements. They are usually used to prevent
writing the same conditions for different functions or restricting access only
to specific addresses. In this case we have two modifiers. The first one is used
to prevent other addresses from listing a token which they do not own, whereas
the second one is used for allowing only the address that has listed the token
to cancel the listing.

- The **listItem(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price)** function:

```solidity
function listItem(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price) public onlyTokenOwner(tokenId) 
    {
        require(!hasBeenListed[tokenId], "The token can only be listed once");
        _transfer(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
        claimableByAccount[tokenId] = msg.sender;
        tokenIdToListing[tokenId] = Listing(
            price,
            msg.sender
        );
        hasBeenListed[tokenId] = true;
        emit ItemListed(tokenId, price, msg.sender);
    }
```

The function takes two parameters, namely the token id and the price. We begin
by defining the constraints which are that only the token owner can list the NFT
and that this NFT has not been listed already. Then we proceed by using the
*_transfer(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId)* function, which is provided by
the **ERC721.sol** contract, and we transfer the token to the
**Marketplace.sol** contract. Then we specify the **msg.sender** as the address
that can cancel the listing and we update the mappings accordingly by creating a
new Listing and by specifying that the token id has been listed. At the end, as
usual, we emit an event.

- The **cancelListing(uint256 tokenId)** function:

```solidity
function cancelListing(uint256 tokenId) public onlyListingAccount(tokenId) 
    {
        _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
        uint256 price = tokenIdToListing[tokenId].price;
        delete claimableByAccount[tokenId];
        delete tokenIdToListing[tokenId];
        delete hasBeenListed[tokenId];
        emit ListingCancelled(tokenId, price, msg.sender);
    }
```

Here our constraint is that only the address that has listed the item can cancel
the listing. Since the mapping claimableByAccount\[tokenId] is then cleared via
the delete keyword we do not need to check that the item has been listed. Here
we transfer the item from the Marketplace smart contract back to the one who
listed it, clear the mappings and emit an event by providing it information
about the token id, the price and who cancelled the listing.

- The **buyItem(uint256 tokenId)** function:

```solidity
function buyItem(uint256 tokenId) public payable {
        require(hasBeenListed[tokenId], "The token needs to be listed in order to be bought.");
        require(tokenIdToListing[tokenId].price == msg.value, "You need to pay the correct price.");

        //split up the price between owner and creator
        uint256 royaltyForCreator = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].royalty.mul(msg.value).div(100);
        uint256 remainder = msg.value.sub(royaltyForCreator);
        //send to creator
        (bool isRoyaltySent, ) = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].creator.call{value: royaltyForCreator}("");
        require(isRoyaltySent, "Failed to send AVAX");
        //send to owner
        (bool isRemainderSent, ) = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].owner.call{value: remainder}("");
        require(isRemainderSent, "Failed to send AVAX");

        //transfer the token from the smart contract back to the buyer
        _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);

        //Modify the owner property of the item to be the buyer
        Item storage item = tokenIdToItem[tokenId];
        item.owner = msg.sender;

        //clean up
        delete tokenIdToListing[tokenId];
        delete claimableByAccount[tokenId];
        delete hasBeenListed[tokenId];
        emit ItemBought(tokenId, msg.value, msg.sender);
    }
```

Here the function takes the token id as a parameter and is a **payable**
function, meaning that the user can send AVAX via it to the smart contract. We
then first check whether the item has been listed and whether the **msg.value**
which we send with our function call equals the price of the token. If that is
the case we split up the **msg.value** based on the royalty that is defined in
the **Item**. **msg.value** is another global variable in Solidity:

```solidity
uint256 royaltyForCreator = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].royalty.mul(msg.value).div(100);
uint256 remainder = msg.value.sub(royaltyForCreator);
```

In the first line we multiply the royalty by the msg.value and then divide it by
100, since we are talking about percentages. Meaning that if the buyer pays 10
AVAX for the NFT and the royalty is 20%, 2 AVAX would go to the creator and the
remaining 8 AVAX would go to the seller. This happens in the next lines:

```solidity
(bool isRoyaltySent, ) = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].creator.call{value: royaltyForCreator}("");
require(isRoyaltySent, "Failed to send AVAX");
(bool isRemainderSent, ) = tokenIdToItem[tokenId].owner.call{value: remainder}("");
require(isRemainderSent, "Failed to send AVAX");
```

Afterwards we transfer the NFT from the Marketplace smart contract to the buyer
and update the **Item** by modifying the **owner** property. Finally, as we did
before, we clean up the mappings and emit an event passing the necessary
information to it.

- At the end we define a view function which is used to obtain information about
  a certain listing. Again, calling this function costs no gas.

```solidity
    function getListing(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (uint256, address)
    {
        return (tokenIdToListing[tokenId].price, tokenIdToListing[tokenId].owner);
    }
}
```

### Testing Our Smart Contracts

Now that we have finished writing our smart contracts it is very important that
we test them thoroughly for erroneous behaviour. As we know, once deployed on
the blockchain, they are immutable. We will be using
[Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) for testing our contracts. It is integrated
into the Truffle framework, so we do not need to install it. We do, however,
need [Open Zeppelin's Test
Helpers](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/0.5/), so we will import
these in our tests. With that in mind, let us quickly jump into the **test/**
directory of our project root and inside of it create two files, namely:

- [**collectible.test.ts**](./test/collectible.test.ts)
- [**marketplace.test.ts**](./test/marketplace.test.ts)

I. Let us start with the first one:

As you may notice most of the actions are repetitive, but will note down some
key components which you would need in order to understand how to approach some
often met cases.

1. First, we import our dependencies at the top and then we define the scope of our test:

    ```typescript
    const Collectible = artifacts.require('./Collectible')
    import { expectRevert } from '@openzeppelin/test-helpers'

    contract('Collectible', ([contractDeployer, creator, buyer]) => {
    ```

    As you can see we import the **Collectible** contract and also an
    `expectRevert` function that will help us with checking whether the functions
    revert correctly upon false input. Afterwards, we define the scope of our test.
    Truffle uses the **contract()** function instead of Mocha's **describe()**
    function. The differences are minimal, so think of them as identical. If you are
    curious, check out the Truffle docs about the
    [explanation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript#use-contract-instead-of-describe-).
    The first parameter is the contract name, the second is simply a list of
    addresses. In this case Truffle's testing environment provides us with 10
    accounts, each funded with 100 ETH. Yes, the Truffle's testing environment is
    based on Ethereum, but since the C-Chain is
    [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) compatible, think of them as
    100 AVAX. Of course, these funds are not real ones and serve only for testing
    purposes.

2. Afterwards, we define a **before()** hook. This hook runs before our tests
   and we can use it to deploy the contract.

    ```typescript
    let collectible;

    before(async () => {
        collectible = await Collectible.new({ from: contractDeployer })
    });
    ```

    Note: We do not actually need **{from: contractDeployer}** as a parameter. If it
    is missing, Truffle would automatically take the first address into
    consideration for the function call. However, you will see that for minting an
    NFT we would use the **creator** address, so we would then need to specify this.
    Each function of our contracts would be part of a **describe()** block. That way
    we can structure our tests efficiently, so that we can find our way easier.

3. In the first **describe()** block we test whether our contract was deployed
   correctly. For that we need to write individual tests or **it()**.

    ```typescript
    describe('Collectible deployment', async () => {
            it('Deploys the Collectible SC successfully.', async () => {
                console.log('Address is ', collectible.address)
                assert.notEqual(collectible.address, '', 'should not be empty');
                assert.notEqual(collectible.address, 0x0, 'should not be the 0x0 address');
                assert.notEqual(collectible.address, null, 'should not be null');
                assert.notEqual(collectible.address, undefined, 'should not be undefined');
            })

            it('The collectible SC should have a name and a symbol.', async () => {
                const name = await collectible.name()
                assert.equal(name, 'NFTCollectible', 'The name should be NFTCollectible.')
                const symbol = await collectible.symbol()
                assert.equal(symbol, 'NFTC', 'The symbol should be NFTC.')
            })
    })
    ```

    As you can see an **it()** function takes as parameters a description of the
    test and an asynchronous function. In the first case, we check whether the
    collectible.address is not equal to those illegal values. In the second test we
    check whether our **Collectible.sol** has a name and a symbol. Since those
    variables are public in the **ERC721.sol** implementation we can call them as
    getters. The value is stored in a variable and then this variable is compared to
    the expected name. If you jump to the **Collectible.sol** file you can see the
    expected name in the **constructor()**.

4. In the second **describe()** block we test our **createCollectible()**
   function. For that we need to write individual tests for every statement that
   we make.

    ```typescript
     describe('Mint an NFT and set a royalty.', async () => {

            it('The hash \'metadata\' is not minted before the function call.', async () => {
                const hasBeenMinted = await collectible.hasBeenMinted('metadata')
                assert.equal(hasBeenMinted, false, 'The hash \'metadata\' has not been minted, so it should be false.')
            })

            it('The royalty needs to be a number between 0 and 40.', async () => {
                await expectRevert(collectible.createCollectible('metadata', 41), "Royalties must be between 0% and 40%.");
            })

            it('Give a new id to a newly created token', async () => {
                const newTokenId = await collectible.createCollectible.call('metadata', 20, { from: creator })
                assert.equal(parseInt(newTokenId.toString()), 1, 'The new token id should be 1.')
            })

            it('Mint a NFT and emit events.', async () => {
                const result = await collectible.createCollectible('metadata', 20, { from: creator })
                assert.equal(result.logs.length, 2, 'Should trigger two events.');
                //event Transfer
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].event, 'Transfer', 'Should be the \'Transfer\' event.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.from, 0x0, 'Should be the 0x0 address.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.to, creator, 'Should log the recipient which is the creator.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.tokenId, 1, 'Should log the token id which is 1.');

                //event ItemMinted
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].event, 'ItemMinted', 'Should be the \'ItemMinted\' event.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.tokenId, 1, 'Should be the token id 1.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.creator, creator, 'Should log the creator.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.metadata, 'metadata', 'Should log the metadata correctly.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.royalty, 20, 'Should log the royalty as 20.');
            })

            it('The items array has a length of 1.', async () => {
                const itemsLength = await collectible.getItemsLength()
                assert.equal(itemsLength, 1, 'The items array should have 1 entry in it.')
            })

            it('The new item has the correct data.', async () => {
                const item = await collectible.getItem(1)
                assert.notEqual(item['0'], buyer, 'The buyer should not be the creator.')
                assert.equal(item['0'], creator, 'The creator is the owner.')
                assert.equal(item['1'], creator, 'The creator is the creator.')
                assert.equal(item['2'], 20, 'The royalty is set to 20.')
            })

            it('Check if hash has been minted and that you cannot mint the same hash again.', async () => {
                const hasBeenMinted = await collectible.hasBeenMinted('metadata')
                assert.equal(hasBeenMinted, true, 'The hash \'metadata\' has been minted.')
                await expectRevert(collectible.createCollectible('metadata', 30, { from: creator }), 'This metadata has already been used to mint an NFT.');
            })
        })
    ```

    - First we check that the *'metadata'* is not minted. For that we call the
      **hasBeenMinted('metadata')** function which is in fact our mapping in our
      **Collectible.sol** file. This returns us a boolean which is false.
    - Afterwards, we expect that the minting function reverts if we provide a
      royalty that is not between 0% and 40%. In that case we try with 41%.
    - Then, before we complete the transaction we can check what the return value
      would be. As we know, our **createCollectible()** function returns a token id.
      We can grab this by executing the function without changing the state:

    ```typescript
    it('Give a new id to a newly created token', async () => {
        const newTokenId = await collectible.createCollectible.call('metadata', 20, { from: creator })
        assert.equal(parseInt(newTokenId.toString()), 1, 'The new token id should be 1.')
    })
    ```

    Then we simply compare the newTokenId to 1 and expect them to be equal, since
    our first NFT should have the token id 1.

    - Now we do not only execute the **createCollectible()** function but also
      change the state in our next **it()**:

    ```typescript
    it('Mint a NFT and emit events.', async () => {
                const result = await collectible.createCollectible('metadata', 20, { from: creator })
                assert.equal(result.logs.length, 2, 'Should trigger two events.');
                //event Transfer
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].event, 'Transfer', 'Should be the \'Transfer\' event.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.from, 0x0, 'Should be the 0x0 address.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.to, creator, 'Should log the recipient which is the creator.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.tokenId, 1, 'Should log the token id which is 1.');

                //event ItemMinted
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].event, 'ItemMinted', 'Should be the \'ItemMinted\' event.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.tokenId, 1, 'Should be the token id 1.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.creator, creator, 'Should log the creator.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.metadata, 'metadata', 'Should log the metadata correctly.');
                assert.equal(result.logs[1].args.royalty, 20, 'Should log the royalty as 20.');
            })
    ```

    Our variable which is the result of the function call is no longer the token id,
    but a transaction receipt, meaning that we obtain much more information out of
    it. Cool, right? Let us put this information to use. We test whether the correct
    events are emitted since they are the signal that we need. In this case we have
    two. One is the *Transfer* event which comes from the **\_safeMint(msg.sender,
    newItemId)** function of the **ERC721.sol** smart contract. The other one is our
    own *ItemMinted* event. We check for the correct name and the correct arguments.

    - In the remaining **it()**-s we check whether the mappings were updated
      accordingly and whether our **Item** has the correct values. Our final
      **it()** makes sure that the transaction reverts if we call the
      **createCollectible()** function with the same metadata parameter value.

5. Now that we are done writing the test, in our console we simply run the command:

```powershell
npx truffle test
```

Note: You might notice that this would run the command *truffle compile*
beforehand. This would create a **build/contracts** folder in our root directory
where the .json representations of all of our used contracts are stored. These
are in fact used when you call functions on the frontend.

II. Go inside the [**marketplace.test.ts**](./test/marketplace.test.ts) file and
have a look at the code. As you may notice, most of the concepts such as testing
the deployment, function reverts and emitted events are repeated here, so I will
only go through the differences:

1. Once again, at the top we are importing the **Marketplace** contract as well as some helping functions:

    ```typescript
    const Marketplace = artifacts.require('./Marketplace')
    const { toBN } = web3.utils
    import { expectRevert, BN } from '@openzeppelin/test-helpers'
    import { convertTokensToWei } from '../utils/tokens'
    ```

    We use the **toBN()** function to convert the balances of the addresses, which
    are returned as strings, to Big Numbers, so that we can perform an adding. We
    also import a function **convertTokenToWei** from a **utils/** folder of our
    project's root which we do not have yet, so let us create it and inside of it
    create a [**tokens.ts**](./utils/tokens.ts) file.
    Then copy the code below in there:

    ```typescript
    export const convertTokensToWei = (n) => {
        return web3.utils.toWei(n, 'ether')
    }

    module.exports = { convertTokensToWei }
    ```

    We use this function, so that we do not have to write 18 zeroes after the AVAX
    amount that a buyer would pay for a NFT. In reality, transferring 5 AVAX means
    that we transfer 5000000000000000000 as a value. In order to not have to write
    all those zeroes, we can simply call convertTokensToWei('5') and the function
    will add the zeroes for us.
    Now, back to our [**marketplace.test.ts**](./test/marketplace.test.ts) test script.

2. We create a **before()** hook. There we deploy the marketplace contract and
   we also mint a NFT. Notice again that our **Marketplace.sol** has all the
   functions which **Collectible.sol** has, hence we can call the
   **createCollectible()** function:

    ```typescript
    before(async () => {
            marketplace = await Marketplace.new({ from: contractDeployer })
            await marketplace.createCollectible('metadata', 20, { from: creator })
    });
    ```

    In this case the creator address is the one who calls the function and therefore
    is the owner of the first NFT.

3. Afterwards, we simply test every statement which we make inside the function
   just like we did for the **collectible.test.ts**.
4. We do the same for the **cancelListing()** function.
5. For the **buyItem()** function things are not that different. The interesting
   part is the final **it()** where we check the balances of the seller, buyer
   and creator after the second sale, since for the first one the seller is
   equal to the creator:

    ```typescript
    it('The balances of creator, first buyer who is now the seller and second buyer are correct.', async () => {
                //List the item again, only this time by the new owner
                await marketplace.listItem(1, convertTokensToWei('10'), { from: buyer })
                const balanceOfBuyerBeforePurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(buyer)
                const balanceOfCreatorBeforePurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(creator)
                const balanceOfSecondBuyerBeforePurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(secondBuyer)
                await marketplace.buyItem(1, { from: secondBuyer, value: convertTokensToWei('10') })
                const balanceOfSecondBuyerAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(secondBuyer)
                const isCorrectSecondBuyerBalanceDifference = toBN(balanceOfSecondBuyerAfterPurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10'))).lt(toBN(balanceOfSecondBuyerBeforePurchase))
                assert.equal(isCorrectSecondBuyerBalanceDifference, true, 'The balance of the second buyer should decrease by 10 AVAX plus gas paid.')
                const balanceOfBuyerAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(buyer)
                const balanceOfCreatorAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(creator)
                assert.equal(balanceOfBuyerAfterPurchase, toBN(balanceOfBuyerBeforePurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10')).mul(new BN('80')).div(new BN('100'))), 'The balance of the seller should increase by 80% of the sold amount.')
                assert.equal(balanceOfCreatorAfterPurchase, toBN(balanceOfCreatorBeforePurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10')).mul(new BN('20')).div(new BN('100'))), 'The balance of the creator should increase by 20% of the sold amount.')
            })
    ```

    What we do here is that the new owner lists the item for 10 AVAX. He is denoted
    by the **buyer** address, since he has previously bought the NFT from the
    creator. A `secondBuyer` purchases the item, so we check whether the
    `secondBuyer` has at least 10 AVAX less, because we need to take into account
    the gas paid:

    ```typescript
    const balanceOfSecondBuyerBeforePurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(secondBuyer)
                await marketplace.buyItem(1, { from: secondBuyer, value: convertTokensToWei('10') })
                const balanceOfSecondBuyerAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(secondBuyer)
                const isCorrectSecondBuyerBalanceDifference = toBN(balanceOfSecondBuyerAfterPurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10'))).lt(toBN(balanceOfSecondBuyerBeforePurchase))
                assert.equal(isCorrectSecondBuyerBalanceDifference, true, 'The balance of the second buyer should decrease by 10 AVAX plus gas paid.')
    ```

    For the **creator** we also check their balance before and after the purchase
    and that it needs to be larger by 20% of the purchase amount. The seller which
    is in this case the **buyer** address should get 80% of the price:

    ```typescript
    const balanceOfBuyerAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(buyer)
    const balanceOfCreatorAfterPurchase = await web3.eth.getBalance(creator)
    assert.equal(balanceOfBuyerAfterPurchase, toBN(balanceOfBuyerBeforePurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10')).mul(new BN('80')).div(new BN('100'))), 'The balance of the seller should increase by 80% of the sold amount.')
    assert.equal(balanceOfCreatorAfterPurchase, toBN(balanceOfCreatorBeforePurchase).add(toBN(convertTokensToWei('10')).mul(new BN('20')).div(new BN('100'))), 'The balance of the creator should increase by 20% of the sold amount.')
    ```

6. Now that we are done writing the test, in our console we simply run the command:

    ```powershell
    npx truffle test
    ```

7. To check the test coverage we can run the command:

    ```powershell
    truffle run coverage
    ```

### Deploying Our Smart Contracts

1. Now that our contracts have passed the tests, let us have a look at the
   sub-dir **migrations/** folder which Truffle provided us in the beginning.
   Inside of it we have the
   [**1_initial_migration.ts**](./migrations/1_initial_migration.ts) script
   which is used to deploy the [**Migrations.sol**](./contracts/Migrations.sol)
   contract that is available in the **contracts/** folder. This contract simply
   keeps track of the migrations that we do. In order to migrate our own
   contracts, we create another script called
   [**2_deploy_contracts.ts**](./migrations/2_deploy_contracts.ts) and inside of
   it paste the following lines of code:

```typescript
const Collectible = artifacts.require('Collectible')
const Marketplace = artifacts.require('Marketplace')

module.exports = function (deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(Collectible)
    deployer.deploy(Marketplace)
} as Truffle.Migration

// because of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40900791/cannot-redeclare-block-scoped-variable-in-unrelated-files
export { }
```

As you can see, it is pretty straightforward. We import the contracts and deploy
them via the deployer parameter. This is taken care by Truffle.

2.1. In order to deploy our contracts to the [Fuji
testnet](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/fuji-workflow), all
we need to do is simply run the command:

```powershell
truffle migrate --network fuji
```

2.2. And should we want to deploy to the Avalanche C-Chain, we simply run:

```powershell
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

## Conclusion

To sum up, in this tutorial we got familiar with the following concepts:

1. We managed to create our very own [ERC721 smart
   contract](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/the-anatomy-of-erc721-e9db77abfc24)
   based on the [Open Zeppelin
   implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol)
   utilizing the Truffle framework;
2. We extended this contract by including royalties;
3. We created a marketplace where one could list their NFTs, cancel their
   listings or buy other NFTs;
4. We learned how to test our smart contracts extensively using the integrated
   Mocha.js library in Truffle;
5. We deployed our final contracts to the Fuji testnet;

Last but not least, should you try to extend the smart contracts, here are some potential ideas:

- For the [**Collectible.sol**](./contracts/Collectible.sol) you could add more
  special properties for your NFTs should you want to use gamification;
- For the [**Marketplace.sol**](./contracts/Marketplace.sol) you could implement
  the option to bid on an item;
- Include an expiration date for a listing on the marketplace;

Or literally anything else that comes to your mind. The opportunities are limitless :)
