# Transfer AVAX Between the P-Chain and C-Chain

## Introduction

AVAX tokens exist on the X-Chain, where they can be traded, on the P-Chain, where they can be provided as a stake when validating the Primary Network, and on the C-Chain, where they can be used in smart contracts or to pay for gas. Avalanche supports movement of AVAX between these chains. In this tutorial, we’ll send AVAX tokens between the C-Chain and P-Chain.

## Requirements

You've completed [Getting Started](../nodes-and-staking/run-avalanche-node.md) and are familiar with [Avalanche's architecture](../../../learn/platform-overview/README.md).

In order to send AVAX, you need to have some AVAX! You can get real AVAX by buying it on an exchange, or you can get testnet AVAX from the [AVAX Test Faucet](https://faucet.avax-test.network), which is a free and easy way to get to play around with Avalanche.

## Transferring AVAX Using the Web Wallet

The easiest way to transfer AVAX between chains is to use [the Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/), which is a non-custodial and secure way to access and move AVAX.

The Avalanche Wallet source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-wallet).

### Step 1 - Open the Avalanche Wallet

![Image for post](/img/wallet-x2p-01-login.png)

Select **Access Wallet** to enter your wallet. To connect the wallet to a network other than the main Avalanche network, select **Mainnet** and choose the network to connect to.

### Step 2 - Log In to Your Wallet

You can access your wallet using the private key, mnemonic key phrase, keystore file or Ledger Nano S.

After a successful login you will see your balance, assets portfolio and various other information.

### Step 3 - Go to the Cross Chain Tab

Functionality for transferring tokens between chains is on the **Cross Chain** tab.

### Step 4 - Enter Amount to Transfer

You will be presented with a choice for **Source Chain** and **Destination Chain**. Select P-Chain and C-Chain, respectively. You will see your source chain's balance, and an input field for entering the amount to transfer from source to destination chain. If you do not have any balance on your P-Chain but on X-Chain, then you can follow this [tutorial](./transfer-avax-between-x-chain-and-p-chain.md) to transfer it to P-Chain.

Enter the amount you wish to transfer from the P-Chain to the C-Chain.

### Step 5 - Confirm the Transaction

Press **Confirm**, and then **Transfer** to initiate the transfer.

### Step 6 - Done!

A cross-chain transfer is a two step process: first a transaction to export the funds from the P-Chain (source chain), and another to import it to the P-Chain (destination chain). The wallet will do both and show its the progress while doing so.

That's it! You've transferred AVAX from the P-Chain to C-Chain! Now you can use them to deploy smart contracts on C-Chain or pay for transaction fees while interacting with smart contracts.

### Transfer from C-Chain to P-Chain

To return the AVAX back to the P-Chain, you need to do the transfer in the opposite direction.

Swap the source and destination chains by selecting them from the **Source** and **Destination** drop-down menu. The rest of the process is the same: enter the amount, confirm and transfer.

## Transferring from the P-Chain to C-Chain with API Calls

If you're building an application on the Avalanche network, you may want to do the transfer programmatically as part of some broader functionality. You can do that by calling the appropriate APIs on an AvalancheGo node. The rest of the tutorial assumes you have access to an AvalancheGo node, AVAX tokens on the P-Chain, and user credentials [created](../../avalanchego-apis/keystore.md#keystorecreateuser) and stored in the node's keystore.

All the example API calls below assume the node is running locally (that is, listening on `127.0.0.1`). The node can be connected to the main network, a test network or a local network. In each case, the API calls and responses should be the same, except for the address formats. The node need not be local; you can make calls to a node hosted elsewhere.

As you may have noticed while transferring AVAX using the Avalanche Wallet, a cross-chain transfer is a two transaction operation:

* Export AVAX from the P-Chain (source)
* Import AVAX to the C-chain (destination)

Before we can do the transfer, we need to set up the address on the C-Chain, along with the controlling key.

### Set Up Address and Key on the C-Chain

The P-Chain and X-Chain uses [Bech32](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587392-what-is-bech32) addresses and the C-Chain uses hex Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses. There is no way to convert the address from one format to the other since they are both derived from a private key using a one-way cryptographic function.

In order to get around this, you can export a private key from the X-Chain and then import it to the C-Chain. This way, you can use the X-Chain address and change the X- prefix to a C- prefix in order to get the correct Bech32 address to use for the C-Chain.

First, export a private key from the X-Chain:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.exportKey",
    "params" :{
        "username" :"myUsername",
        "password":"myPassword",
        "address": "X-avax1fw57u4tp7xzx0k6ufn7tj9caua59mt9gqcvy7m"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

Response:

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "result" :{
        "privateKey":"PrivateKey-2w4XiXxPfQK4TypYqnohRL8DRNTz9cGiGmwQ1zmgEqD9c9KWLq"
    }
}
```

Now, import the same private key to the C-Chain:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{  
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"avax.importKey", 
    "params" :{ 
        "username" :"myUsername",   
        "password":"myPassword",    
        "privateKey":"PrivateKey-2w4XiXxPfQK4TypYqnohRL8DRNTz9cGiGmwQ1zmgEqD9c9KWLq"    
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax
```

The response contains a hex-encoded EVM address:

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "address": "0x5Bf544EF123FE41B262295dBA41c5a9CFA8efDB4"
    },
    "id": 1
}
```

Now we have everything we need to transfer the tokens.

### Transfer from the P-Chain to C-Chain

Use the address corresponding to the private key you exported and switch to using the C- prefix in the [`platform.exportAVAX`](../../avalanchego-apis/p-chain.md#platformexportavax) call:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{  
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"platform.exportAVAX",
    "params" :{ 
        "assetID": "AVAX",
        "to": "C-avax1fw57u4tp7xzx0k6ufn7tj9caua59mt9gqcvy7m"
        "amount": 5000000,  
        "username":"myUsername",    
        "password":"myPassword" 
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/P
```

Since your keystore user owns the corresponding private key on the C-Chain, you can now import the AVAX to the address of your choice. It’s not necessary to import it to the same address that it was exported to; you can import the AVAX to an address that you own in MetaMask or another third-party service.

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"avax.import",
    "params" :{ 
        "to":"0x4b879aff6b3d24352Ac1985c1F45BA4c3493A398",  
        "sourceChain":"P",
        "username":"myUsername",    
        "password":"myPassword" 
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax
```

where `to` is a hex-encoded EVM address of your choice.

The response looks like this:

```cpp
{   
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",   
    "result": { 
        "txID": "LWTRsiKnEUJC58y8ezAk6hhzmSMUCtemLvm3LZFw8fxDQpns3" 
    },  
    "id": 1 
}
```

Note: there is no transaction fee for import transactions to the C Chain.

Once your AVAX has been transferred to the C-Chain, you can use it to deploy and interact with smart contracts.

## Transfer from the C-Chain to P-Chain

Now, you can move AVAX back from the C-Chain to the P-Chain. First we need to export:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{  
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    
    "id"     :1,    
    "method" :"avax.exportAVAX",
    "params" :{ 
        "to":"P-avax1fw57u4tp7xzx0k6ufn7tj9caua59mt9gqcvy7m",   
        "assetID": "AVAX",
        "amount": 5000000,  
        "username":"myUsername",    
        "password":"myPassword" 
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/avax
```

where `to` is the bech32 encoded address of an P-Chain address you hold. Make sure that the amount you export exceeds the transaction fee because both the export and import transactions will charge a transaction fee.

The response should look like this:

```cpp
{   
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",   
    "result": { 
        "txID": "2ZDt3BNwzA8vm4CMP42pWD242VZy7TSWYUXEuBifkDh4BxbCvj"    
    },  
    "id": 1 
}
```

To finish the transfer, call P-Chain’s [`platform.importAVAX`](../../avalanchego-apis/p-chain.md#platformimportavax)

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{  
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    
    "id"     :1,    
    "method": "platform.importAVAX",
    "params": { 
        "username":"myUsername",    
        "password":"myPassword",    
        "sourceChain": "C", 
        "to":"P-avax1fw57u4tp7xzx0k6ufn7tj9caua59mt9gqcvy7m"    
    }   
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/P
```

where `to` is the bech32 encoded address the P-Chain address which you sent the funds to in the previous step.

The response should look like this:

```cpp
{   
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",   
    "result": { 
        "txID": "2kxwWpHvZPhMsJcSTmM7a3Da7sExB8pPyF7t4cr2NSwnYqNHni"    
    },  
    "id": 1 
}
```

## Wrapping Up

That’s it! Now, you can swap AVAX back and forth between the P-Chain and C-Chain, both by using the Avalanche Wallet, and by calling the appropriate API calls on an Avalanche node.
