# Deploy a Smart Contract on Your Subnet EVM Using Remix and Metamask

## Introduction

This tutorial assumes that:
- A [Subnet](create-a-subnet.md) has been created
- An [EVM blockchain](create-evm-blockchain.md) has been created
- Your Node is currently [validating](create-a-subnet.md#adding-subnet-validators) your target Subnet
- Your wallet has a balance of the Subnet Native Token(Specified under _alloc_ in your [Genesis File](create-evm-blockchain.md#build-genesis))

## Step 1: Setting up MetaMask

#### **EVM Subnet Settings:** [(EVM Metamask Tutorial)](create-evm-blockchain.md#connect-with-metamask)

* **``Network Name``**: Custom Subnet EVM
* **``New RPC URL``**: http://NodeIPAddress:9650/ext/bc/BlockchainID/rpc (Note: the port number should match your local setting which can be different from 9650.)
* **``ChainID``**: Subnet EVM ChainID
* **``Symbol``**: Subnet EVM Token Symbol
* **``Explorer``**: N/A

You should see a balance of your Subnet's Native Token in Metamask.

## Step 2: Connect MetaMask and Deploy a Smart Contract 

### Using Remix

Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) -&gt; Select Solidity.

Create the smart contracts that we want to compile and deploy using Remix file explorer

### Using Github

In Remix Home _Click_ the GitHub button.

![remix subnet evm sc load panel](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-load-panel.png)

Paste the [link to the Smart Contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/NFT.sol) into the popup and _Click_ import.

![remix subnet evm sc import](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-import.png)

For this example, we will deploy an ERC721 contract from the [Avalanche Smart Contract Quickstart Repo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart).

![remix subnet evm sc file explorer](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-file-explorer.png)

Navigate to Deploy Tab -&gt; Open the "ENVIRONMENT" drop-down and select Injected Web3 (make sure MetaMask is loaded).

![remix subnet evm sc web3](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-web3.png)

Once we injected the web3-&gt; Go back to the compiler, and compile the selected contract -&gt; Navigate to Deploy Tab.

![remix subnet evm sc compile](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-compile.png)

Now, the smart contract is compiled, MetaMask is injected, and we are ready to deploy our ERC721. Click "Deploy."

![remix subnet evm sc deploy](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-deploy.png)


Confirm the transaction on the MetaMask pop up.

Our contract is successfully deployed!

![remix subnet evm sc deployed](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-deployed.png)

Now, we can expand it by selecting it from the "Deployed Contracts" tab and test it out.

![remix subnet evm sc end](/img/remix-subnet-evm-sc-end.png)

The contract ABI and Bytecode are available on the compiler tab.

## Other Tools

You can use Subnet EVM just like you use C-Chain and EVM tools. Only differences are `chainID` and RPC URL. For example you can deploy your contracts with [hardhat quick start guide](../../smart-contracts/using-hardhat-with-the-avalanche-c-chain.md) by changing `url` and `chainId` in the `hardhat.config.ts`.
