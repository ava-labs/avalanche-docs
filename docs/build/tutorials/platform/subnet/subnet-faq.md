# Subnet FAQ

**Work in Progress**

## Introduction

See [this doc](README.md) for an overview.

## Compatibility

### Can I create a subnet for xxx?

The answer is usually yes, because Subnet provides great flexibility to work almost anything.

## Fees

### How much does it cost to create a subnet?

1 AVAX based on [this doc.](../../../../learn/platform-overview/transaction-fees.md#fee-schedule)

### Could it be possible to create a subnet with free transaction?

Fee is used to fight against DoS (denial of service) attacks. It's possible to create a subnet with free transaction, however, it requires modification to existing VMs and is certainly not advised.

### Does it means we can validate a blockchain transaction with another currency than AVAX? 

Blockchains in subnets use their own currencies. for instance see [here.](create-avm-blockchain.md#create-the-genesis-data)
