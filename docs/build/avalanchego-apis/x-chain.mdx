# Exchange Chain (X-Chain) API

The [X-Chain](../../learn/platform-overview/README.md#exchange-chain-x-chain), Avalanche’s native platform for creating and trading assets, is an instance of the Avalanche Virtual Machine (AVM). This API allows clients to create and trade assets on the X-Chain and other instances of the AVM.

## Format

This API uses the `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see [here](issuing-api-calls.md).

## Endpoints

`/ext/bc/X` to interact with the X-Chain.

`/ext/bc/blockchainID` to interact with other AVM instances, where `blockchainID` is the ID of a blockchain running the AVM.

## Methods

### avm.buildGenesis

Given a JSON representation of this Virtual Machine’s genesis state, create the byte representation of that state.

#### **Endpoint**

This call is made to the AVM’s static API endpoint:

`/ext/vm/avm`

Note: addresses should not include a chain prefix (ie. X-) in calls to the static API endpoint because these prefixes refer to a specific chain.

#### **Signature**

```sh
avm.buildGenesis({
    networkID: int,
    genesisData: JSON,
    encoding: string, //optional
}) -> {
    bytes: string,
    encoding: string,
}
```

Encoding specifies the encoding format to use for arbitrary bytes ie. the genesis bytes that are returned. Can be either "cb58" or "hex". Defaults to "cb58".

`genesisData` has this form:

```json
{
"genesisData" :
    {
        "assetAlias1": {               // Each object defines an asset
            "name": "human readable name",
            "symbol":"AVAL",           // Symbol is between 0 and 4 characters
            "initialState": {
                "fixedCap" : [         // Choose the asset type.
                    {                  // Can be "fixedCap", "variableCap", "limitedTransfer", "nonFungible"
                        "amount":1000, // At genesis, address A has
                        "address":"A"  // 1000 units of asset
                    },
                    {
                        "amount":5000, // At genesis, address B has
                        "address":"B"  // 1000 units of asset
                    },
                    ...                // Can have many initial holders
                ]
            }
        },
        "assetAliasCanBeAnythingUnique": { // Asset alias can be used in place of assetID in calls
            "name": "human readable name", // names need not be unique
            "symbol": "AVAL",              // symbols need not be unique
            "initialState": {
                "variableCap" : [          // No units of the asset exist at genesis
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signature of A or B can mint more of
                            "A",           // the asset.
                            "B"
                        ],
                        "threshold":1
                    },
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signatures of 2 of A, B and C can mint
                            "A",           // more of the asset
                            "B",
                            "C"
                        ],
                        "threshold":2
                    },
                    ...                    // Can have many minter sets
                ]
            }
        },
        ...                                // Can list more assets

### avm.createFixedCapAsset

Create a new fixed-cap, fungible asset. A quantity of it is created at initialization and then no more is ever created. The asset can be sent with `avm.send`. More details can be found [here](../tutorials/smart-digital-assets/create-a-fix-cap-asset.md).

#### **Signature**

```sh
avm.createFixedCapAsset({
    name: string,
    symbol: string,
    denomination: int, //optional

```

* `name` is a human-readable name for the asset. Not necessarily unique.
* `symbol` is a shorthand symbol for the asset. Between 0 and 4 characters. Not necessarily unique. May be omitted.
* `denomination` determines how balances of this asset are displayed by user interfaces. If `denomination` is 0, 100 units of this asset are displayed as 100. If `denomination` is 1, 100 units of this asset are displayed as 10.0. If `denomination` is 2, 100 units of this asset are displayed as 1.00, etc. Defaults to 0.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* `username` and `password` denote the user paying the transaction fee.
* Each element in `initialHolders` specifies that `address` holds `amount` units of the asset at genesis.
* `assetID` is the ID of the new asset.

    changeAddr: string,
}
```

* `amount` units of `assetID` will be created and controlled by address `to`.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* `username` is the user that pays the transaction fee. `username` must hold keys giving it permission to mint more of this asset. That is, it must control at least _threshold_ keys for one of the minter sets.

### avm.mintNFT

Mint non-fungible tokens which were created with [`avm.createNFTAsset`](x-chain.mdx#avmcreatenftasset). More details can be found [here](../tutorials/smart-digital-assets/creating-a-nft-part-1.md).

#### **Signature**

```sh
avm.mintNFT({
    assetID: string,
    payload: string,
    to: string,
    encoding: string, //optional
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,

    txID: string,
    changeAddr: string,
}
```

* `assetID` is the assetID of the newly created NFT asset.
* `payload` is an arbitrary payload of up to 1024 bytes. Its encoding format is specified by the `encoding` argument.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* `username` is the user that pays the transaction fee. `username` must hold keys giving it permission to mint more of this asset. That is, it must control at least _threshold_ keys for one of the minter sets.
* `txID` is this transaction’s ID.

    "id": 1
}
```

Where:

* `credentials` is a list of this transaction's credentials. Each credential proves that this transaction's creator is allowed to consume one of this transaction's inputs. Each credential is a list of signatures.
* `unsignedTx` is the non-signature portion of the transaction.
* `networkID` is the ID of the network this transaction happened on. (Avalanche Mainnet is `1`.)
* `blockchainID` is the ID of the blockchain this transaction happened on. (Avalanche Mainnet X-Chain is `2oYMBNV4eNHyqk2fjjV5nVQLDbtmNJzq5s3qs3Lo6ftnC6FByM`.)
* Each element of `outputs` is an output (UTXO) of this transaction that is not being exported to another chain.
* Each element of `inputs` is an input of this transaction which has not been imported from another chain.
* Import Transactions have additional fields `sourceChain` and `importedInputs`, which specify the blockchain ID that assets are being imported from, and the inputs that are being imported.
* Export Transactions have additional fields `destinationChain` and `exportedOutputs`, which specify the blockchain ID that assets are being exported to, and the UTXOs that are being exported.

An output contains:

* `assetID`: The ID of the asset being transferred. (The Mainnet Avax ID is `FvwEAhmxKfeiG8SnEvq42hc6whRyY3EFYAvebMqDNDGCgxN5Z`.)
* `fxID`: The ID of the FX this output uses.
* `output`: The FX-specific contents of this output.

Most outputs use the secp256k1 FX, look like this:

```json
{
    "assetID": "FvwEAhmxKfeiG8SnEvq42hc6whRyY3EFYAvebMqDNDGCgxN5Z",
    "fxID": "spdxUxVJQbX85MGxMHbKw1sHxMnSqJ3QBzDyDYEP3h6TLuxqQ",
    "output": {
        "addresses": [
            "X-avax126rd3w35xwkmj8670zvf7y5r8k36qa9z9803wm"
        ],
        "amount": 1530084210,
        "locktime": 0,
        "threshold": 1
    }
}
```

The above output can be consumed after Unix time `locktime` by a transaction that has signatures from `threshold` of the addresses in `addresses`.


### avm.getTxStatus

    endIndex: {
        address: string,
        utxo: string
    },
    sourceChain: string, //optional
    encoding: string
}
```

* `utxos` is a list of UTXOs such that each UTXO references at least one address in `addresses`.
* At most `limit` UTXOs are returned. If `limit` is omitted or greater than 1024, it is set to 1024.
* This method supports pagination. `endIndex` denotes the last UTXO returned. To get the next set of UTXOs, use the value of `endIndex` as `startIndex` in the next call.
* If `startIndex` is omitted, will fetch all UTXOs up to `limit`.
* When using pagination (when `startIndex` is provided), UTXOs are not guaranteed to be unique across multiple calls. That is, a UTXO may appear in the result of the first call, and then again in the second call.
* When using pagination, consistency is not guaranteed across multiple calls. That is, the UTXO set of the addresses may have changed between calls.
* `encoding` sets the format for the returned UTXOs. Can be either "cb58" or "hex". Defaults to "cb58".

#### **Example**

Suppose we want all UTXOs that reference at least one of `X-avax1yzt57wd8me6xmy3t42lz8m5lg6yruy79m6whsf` and `X-avax1x459sj0ssujguq723cljfty4jlae28evjzt7xz`.

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{
        "addresses":["X-avax1yzt57wd8me6xmy3t42lz8m5lg6yruy79m6whsf", "X-avax1x459sj0ssujguq723cljfty4jlae28evjzt7xz"],
        "limit":5,
        "encoding": "cb58"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

    },
    "id": 1

```

Since `numFetched` is the same as `limit`, we can tell that there may be more UTXOs that were not fetched. We call the method again, this time with `startIndex`:

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{

        "encoding": "cb58"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X

Since `numFetched` is less than `limit`, we know that we are done fetching UTXOs and don’t need to call this method again.

Suppose we want to fetch the UTXOs exported from the P Chain to the X Chain in order to build an ImportTx. Then we need to call GetUTXOs with the sourceChain argument in order to retrieve the atomic UTXOs:

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{
        "addresses":["X-avax1yzt57wd8me6xmy3t42lz8m5lg6yruy79m6whsf", "X-avax1x459sj0ssujguq723cljfty4jlae28evjzt7xz"],
        "limit":5,
        "sourceChain": "P",
        "encoding": "cb58"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

```json

    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "numFetched": "1",
        "utxos": [

### avm.import

Finalize a transfer of an asset from the P-Chain or C-Chain to the X-Chain. Before this method is called, you must call the P-Chain’s [`platform.exportAVAX`](p-chain.md#platformexportavax) or C-Chain’s [`avax.export`](c-chain.md#avaxexport) method to initiate the transfer.

#### **Signature**

```sh
avm.import({
    to: string,
    sourceChain: string,
    username: string,
    password: string,
}) -> {txID: string}
```

* `to` is the address the AVAX is sent to. This must be the same as the `to` argument in the corresponding call to the P-Chain’s `exportAVAX` or C-Chain's `export`.
* `sourceChain` is the ID or alias of the chain the AVAX is being imported from. To import funds from the C-Chain, use `"C"`.
* `username` is the user that controls `to`.
* `txID` is the ID of the newly created atomic transaction.

#### **Example Call**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.import",
    "params" :{

    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) -> {txID: string, changeAddr: string}
```

* Sends `amount` units of asset with ID `assetID` to address `to`. `amount` is denominated in the smallest increment of the asset. For AVAX this is 1 nAVAX (one billionth of 1 AVAX.)
* `to` is the X-Chain address the asset is sent to.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* You can attach a `memo`, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
* The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

#### **Example Call**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{

* `memo` is an optional message, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

### wallet.send

Send a quantity of an asset to an address and assume the tx will be accepted so that future calls can use the modified UTXO set.

This call is made to the wallet API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/wallet`

#### **Signature**

```sh
wallet.send({
    amount: int,
    assetID: string,
    to: string,
    memo: string, //optional
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) -> {txID: string, changeAddr: string}
```

* Sends `amount` units of asset with ID `assetID` to address `to`. `amount` is denominated in the smallest increment of the asset. For AVAX this is 1 nAVAX (one billionth of 1 AVAX.)
* `to` is the X-Chain address the asset is sent to.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* You can attach a `memo`, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
* The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

#### **Example Call**

```sh
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"wallet.send",
    "params" :{
        "assetID"   : "AVAX",

    }
}
```

### wallet.sendMultiple

Send multiple transfers of `amount` of `assetID`, to a specified address from a list of owned of addresses and assume the tx will be accepted so that future calls can use the modified UTXO set.

This call is made to the wallet API endpoint:

`/ext/bc/X/wallet`

#### **Signature**

```sh
wallet.sendMultiple({
    outputs: []{
      assetID: string,
      amount: int,
      to: string
    },
    from: []string, //optional
    changeAddr: string, //optional
    memo: string, //optional
    username: string,
    password: string
}) -> {txID: string, changeAddr: string}
```

* `outputs` is an array of object literals which each contain an `assetID`, `amount` and `to`.
* `from` are the addresses that you want to use for this operation. If omitted, uses any of your addresses as needed.
* `changeAddr` is the address any change will be sent to. If omitted, change is sent to one of the addresses controlled by the user.
* You can attach a `memo`, whose length can be up to 256 bytes.
* The asset is sent from addresses controlled by user `username`. (Of course, that user will need to hold at least the balance of the asset being sent.)

)

func main() {
    dialer := websocket.Dialer{
        NetDial: func(netw, addr string) (net.Conn, error) {
            return net.Dial(netw, addr)
        },

            if err != nil {
                log.Println(err)
                return
            }
            switch mt {
            case websocket.TextMessage:

            default:
                log.Println(mt, string(msg))
            }
        }
    }

    go readMsg()

    cmd := &pubsub.Command{NewSet: &pubsub.NewSet{}}
    cmdmsg, err := json.Marshal(cmd)

    err = conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, cmdmsg)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    var addresses []string
    addresses = append(addresses, " X-fuji....")
    cmd = &pubsub.Command{AddAddresses: &pubsub.AddAddresses{JSONAddresses: api.JSONAddresses{Addresses: addresses}}}
    cmdmsg, err = json.Marshal(cmd)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

```

**Operations**

| Command | Description | Example | Arguments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NewSet** | create a new address map set | {"newSet":{}} |  |
| **NewBloom** | create a new bloom set. | {"newBloom":{"maxElements":"1000","collisionProb":"0.0100"}} | maxElements - number of elements in filter must be &gt; 0 collisionProb - allowed collision probability must be &gt; 0 and &lt;= 1 |
| **AddAddresses** | add an address to the set | {"addAddresses":{"addresses":\["X-fuji..."\]}} | addresses - list of addresses to match |

Calling **NewSet** or **NewBloom** resets the filter, and must be followed with **AddAddresses**. **AddAddresses** can be called multiple times.

**Set details**

* **NewSet** performs absolute address matches, if the address is in the set you will be sent the transaction.
* **NewBloom** [Bloom filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) can produce false positives, but can allow a greater number of addresses to be filtered.  If the addresses is in the filter, you will be sent the transaction.
