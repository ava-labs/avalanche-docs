# Health API

This API can be used for measuring node health.

To get an HTTP status code response that indicates the node’s health, make a `GET` request to `/ext/health`. If the node is healthy, it will return a `200` status code. If you want more in-depth information about a node’s health, use the methods below.

## Format

This API uses the `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see [here](issuing-api-calls.md).

## Endpoint

```text
/ext/health
```

## Methods

### health.health

The node runs a set of health checks every 30 seconds, including a health check for each chain. This method returns the last set of health check results.

#### **Signature**

```cpp
health.health() -> {
    checks: []{
        checkName: {
            message: JSON,
            error: JSON,
            timestamp: string,
            duration: int,
            contiguousFailures: int,
            timeOfFirstFailure: int
        }
    },
    healthy: bool
}
```

`healthy` is true if the node if all health checks are passing.

`checks` is a list of health check responses.

* A check response may include a `message` with additional context.
* A check response may include an `error` describing why the check failed.
* `timestamp` is the timestamp of the last health check.
* `duration` is the execution duration of the last health check, in nanoseconds.
* `contiguousFailures` is the number of times in a row this check failed.
* `timeOfFirstFailure` is the time this check first failed.

More information on these measurements can be found in the documentation for the [go-sundheit](https://github.com/AppsFlyer/go-sundheit) library.

#### **Example Call**

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"health.health"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/health
```

#### **Example Response**

In this example response, the C-Chain’s health check is failing.
