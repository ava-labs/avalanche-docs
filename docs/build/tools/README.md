# Overview

[**Public API**](public-api.md): Learn about the public API server you can use to interact with the Avalanche Network.

[**Postman Collection**](postman-avalanche-collection.md): An AvalancheGo API template and environment collection for [Postman](https://postman.com/), a tool to simplify API development and experimentation. The collection covers all of AvalancheGo APIs, so you can easily issue commands to a node and examine the output in a nicely formatted, readable way.

[**AvalancheJS**](avalanchejs/README.md) is Avalanche's JavaScript library written in TypesScript which enables browser and Node.js clients to make API calls to Avalanche nodes. It provides a wide suite of tools to make asset creation, balance management, and funds transfer easy. AvalancheJS has tools for managing the node itself, accessing the Admin, Keystore, and Platform APIs built into Avalanche nodes.

[**Avalanche Wallet SDK**](avalanche-wallet-sdk/README.md) is a TypeScript library for managing wallets.

[**Grafana Dashboards**](dashboards/README.mdx): Pre-configured Grafana dashboards

[**Avalanche Network Runner**](network-runner.md): Tool for building and interacting with AvalancheGo networks for development and testing. Networks can be run locally or using Kubernetes.

[**Avalanche Local Simulator**](ava-sim.md): Spin up a local instance of an Avalanche network to interact with the standard APIs or to test a custom VM.

[**Abigen**](abigen.md)**:** allows you to compile `solidity` contracts into a programatic interface suitable for embeding in `golang`.

[**Avash**](avash.md) is a shell client for interacting with Avalanche and can deploy local networks and interact with the nodes in those networks. You can use Avash to rapidly launch test network environments. **Note: Avash is being replaced by the [Avalanche Network Runner.](network-runner.md)**


[**Deprecating Ortelius**](deprecating-ortelius.md): How to replace Ortelius with the Index API

[**Ortelius API**](ortelius.md): Interact with Ortelius, a tool that indexes the Avalanche Network. **Note: Ortelius is deprecated. You should [use the Index API instead.](deprecating-ortelius.md)**
