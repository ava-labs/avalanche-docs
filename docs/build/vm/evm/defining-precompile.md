# Defining Your Precompile

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Now that we have autogenerated the template code required for our precompile, let's actually write the logic for the precompile itself.

## Setting Config Key

Let's jump to `helloworld/module.go` file first. This file contains the module definition for our
precompile. You can see the `ConfigKey` is set to some default value of `helloWorldConfig`.
This key should be unique to the precompile.
This config key determines which JSON key to use when reading the precompile's config from the
JSON upgrade/genesis file. In this case, the config key is `helloWorldConfig` and the JSON config
should look like this:

```json
{
  "helloWorldConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0
		...
  }
}
```

## Setting Contract Address

In the `helloworld/module.go` you can see the `ContractAddress` is set to some default value.
This should be changed to a suitable address for your precompile.
The address should be unique to the precompile. There is a registry of precompile addresses
under [`precompile/registry/registry.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/registry/registry.go).
A list of addresses is specified in the comments under this file.
Modify the default value to be the next user available stateful precompile address. For forks of
Subnet-EVM or Precompile-EVM, users should start at `0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000` to ensure
that their own modifications do not conflict with stateful precompiles that may be added to
Subnet-EVM in the future. You should pick an address that is not already taken.

```go
// This list is kept just for reference. The actual addresses defined in respective packages of precompiles.
// Note: it is important that none of these addresses conflict with each other or any other precompiles
// in core/vm/contracts.go.
// The first stateful precompiles were added in coreth to support nativeAssetCall and nativeAssetBalance. New stateful precompiles
// originating in coreth will continue at this prefix, so we reserve this range in subnet-evm so that they can be migrated into
// subnet-evm without issue.
// These start at the address: 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000 and will increment by 1.
// Optional precompiles implemented in subnet-evm start at 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000 and will increment by 1
// from here to reduce the risk of conflicts.
// For forks of subnet-evm, users should start at 0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000 to ensure
// that their own modifications do not conflict with stateful precompiles that may be added to subnet-evm
// in the future.
// ContractDeployerAllowListAddress = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000")
// ContractNativeMinterAddress      = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001")
// TxAllowListAddress               = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002")
// FeeManagerAddress                = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003")
// RewardManagerAddress             = common.HexToAddress("0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004")
// HelloWorldAddress                = common.HexToAddress("0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000")
// ADD YOUR PRECOMPILE HERE
// {YourPrecompile}Address          = common.HexToAddress("0x03000000000000000000000000000000000000??")
```

Don't forget to update the actual variable `ContractAddress` in `module.go` to the address you chose.
It should look like this:

```go
// ContractAddress is the defined address of the precompile contract.
// This should be unique across all precompile contracts.
// See params/precompile_modules.go for registered precompile contracts and more information.
var ContractAddress = common.HexToAddress("0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000000")
```

Now when Subnet-EVM sees the `helloworld.ContractAddress` as input when executing
[`CALL`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/core/vm/evm.go#L284),
[`CALLCODE`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/core/vm/evm.go#L355),
[`DELEGATECALL`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/core/vm/evm.go#L396),
[`STATICCALL`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/core/vm/evm.go#L445),
it can run the precompile if the precompile is enabled.

## Adding Custom Code

Search (`CTRL F`) throughout the file with `CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE` to find the areas in the
precompile package that you need to modify. You should start with the reference imports code block.

### Module File

The module file contains fundamental information about the precompile. This includes the key for the
precompile, the address of the precompile, and a configurator. This file is located at
[`./precompile/helloworld/module.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/contracts/helloworld/module.go)
for Subnet-EVM and
[./helloworld/module.go](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/blob/hello-world-example/helloworld/module.go)
for Precompile-EVM.

This file defines the module for the precompile. The module is used to register the precompile to the
precompile registry. The precompile registry is used to read configs and enable the precompile.
Registration is done in the `init()` function of the module file. `MakeConfig()` is used to create a
new instance for the precompile config. This will be used in custom Unmarshal/Marshal logic.
You don't need to override these functions.

#### Configure()

Module file contains a `configurator` which implements the `contract.Configurator` interface. This interface
includes a `Configure()` function used to configure the precompile and set the initial
state of the precompile. This function is called when the precompile is enabled. This is typically used
to read from a given config in upgrade/genesis JSON and sets the initial state of the
precompile accordingly. This function also calls `AllowListConfig.Configure()` to invoke AllowList
configuration as the last step. You should keep it as it is if you want to use AllowList.
You can modify this function for your custom logic. You can circle back to this function later
after you have finalized the implementation of the precompile config.

### Config File

The config file contains the config for the precompile. This file is located at
[`./precompile/helloworld/config.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/contracts/helloworld/config.go)
for Subnet-EVM and
[./helloworld/config.go](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/blob/hello-world-example/helloworld/config.go)
for Precompile-EVM.
This file contains the `Config` struct, which implements `precompileconfig.Config` interface.
It has some embedded structs like `precompileconfig.Upgrade`. `Upgrade` is used to enable
upgrades for the precompile. It contains the `BlockTimestamp` and `Disable` to enable/disable
upgrades. `BlockTimestamp` is the timestamp of the block when the upgrade will be activated.
`Disable` is used to disable the upgrade. If you use `AllowList` for the precompile, there is also
`allowlist.AllowListConfig` embedded in the `Config` struct. `AllowListConfig` is used to specify initial
roles for specified addresses. If you have any custom fields in your precompile config, you can add them
here. These custom fields will be read from upgrade/genesis JSON and set in the precompile config.

```go
// Config implements the precompileconfig.Config interface and
// adds specific configuration for HelloWorld.
type Config struct {
	allowlist.AllowListConfig
	precompileconfig.Upgrade
}
```

#### Verify()

`Verify()` is called on startup and an error is treated as fatal. Generated code contains a call
to `AllowListConfig.Verify()` to verify the `AllowListConfig`. You can leave that as is and start
adding your own custom verify code after that.

We can leave this function as is right now because there is no invalid custom configuration for the `Config`.

```go
// Verify tries to verify Config and returns an error accordingly.
func (c *Config) Verify() error {
	// Verify AllowList first
	if err := c.AllowListConfig.Verify(); err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE
	// Add your own custom verify code for Config here
	// and return an error accordingly
	return nil
}
```

#### Equal()

Next, we see is `Equal()`. This function determines if two precompile configs are equal. This is used
to determine if the precompile needs to be upgraded. There is some default code that is generated for
checking `Upgrade` and `AllowListConfig` equality.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```go
// Equal returns true if [s] is a [*Config] and it has been configured identical to [c].
func (c *Config) Equal(s precompileconfig.Config) bool {
	// typecast before comparison
	other, ok := (s).(*Config)
	if !ok {
		return false
	}
	// CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE
	// modify this boolean accordingly with your custom Config, to check if [other] and the current [c] are equal
	// if Config contains only Upgrade  and AllowListConfig  you can skip modifying it.
	equals := c.Upgrade.Equal(&other.Upgrade) && c.AllowListConfig.Equal(&other.AllowListConfig)
	return equals
}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

We can leave this function as is since we check `Upgrade` and `AllowListConfig` for equality which are
the only fields that `Config` struct has.

### Modify Configure()

We can now circle back to `Configure()` in `module.go` as we finished implementing `Config` struct.
This function configures the `state` with the
initial configuration at`blockTimestamp` when the precompile is enabled.
In the HelloWorld example, we want to set up a default
key-value mapping in the state where the key is `storageKey` and the value is `Hello World!`. The
`StateDB` allows us to store a key-value mapping of 32-byte hashes. The below code snippet can be
copied and pasted to overwrite the default `Configure()` code.

```go
const defaultGreeting = "Hello World!"

// Configure configures [state] with the given [cfg] precompileconfig.
// This function is called by the EVM once per precompile contract activation.
// You can use this function to set up your precompile contract's initial state,
// by using the [cfg] config and [state] stateDB.
func (*configurator) Configure(chainConfig contract.ChainConfig, cfg precompileconfig.Config, state contract.StateDB, _ contract.BlockContext) error {
	config, ok := cfg.(*Config)
	if !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("incorrect config %T: %v", config, config)
	}
	// CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE

	// This will be called in the first block where HelloWorld stateful precompile is enabled.
	// 1) If BlockTimestamp is nil, this will not be called
	// 2) If BlockTimestamp is 0, this will be called while setting up the genesis block
	// 3) If BlockTimestamp is 1000, this will be called while processing the first block
	// whose timestamp is >= 1000
	//
	// Set the initial value under [common.BytesToHash([]byte("storageKey")] to "Hello World!"
	StoreGreeting(state, defaultGreeting)
	// AllowList is activated for this precompile. Configuring allowlist addresses here.
	return config.AllowListConfig.Configure(state, ContractAddress)
}
```

### Contract File

The contract file contains the functions of the precompile contract that will be called by the EVM. The
file is located at [`./precompile/helloworld/contract.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/contracts/helloworld/contract.go)
for Subnet-EVM and
[./helloworld/contract.go](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/blob/hello-world-example/helloworld/contract.go)
for Precompile-EVM.
Since we use `IAllowList` interface there will be auto-generated code for `AllowList`
functions like below:

```go
// GetHelloWorldAllowListStatus returns the role of [address] for the HelloWorld list.
func GetHelloWorldAllowListStatus(stateDB contract.StateDB, address common.Address) allowlist.Role {
	return allowlist.GetAllowListStatus(stateDB, ContractAddress, address)
}

// SetHelloWorldAllowListStatus sets the permissions of [address] to [role] for the
// HelloWorld list. Assumes [role] has already been verified as valid.
// This stores the [role] in the contract storage with address [ContractAddress]
// and [address] hash. It means that any reusage of the [address] key for different value
// conflicts with the same slot [role] is stored.
// Precompile implementations must use a different key than [address] for their storage.
func SetHelloWorldAllowListStatus(stateDB contract.StateDB, address common.Address, role allowlist.Role) {
	allowlist.SetAllowListRole(stateDB, ContractAddress, address, role)
}
```

These will be helpful to use AllowList precompile helper in our functions.

#### Packers and Unpackers

There are also auto-generated Packers and Unpackers for the ABI. These will be used in `sayHello` and
`setGreeting` functions to comfort the ABI.
These functions are auto-generated
and will be used in necessary places accordingly.
You don't need to worry about how to deal with them, but it's good to know what they are.

Each input to a precompile contract function has it's own `Unpacker` function as follows:

```go
// UnpackSetGreetingInput attempts to unpack [input] into the string type argument
// assumes that [input] does not include selector (omits first 4 func signature bytes)
func UnpackSetGreetingInput(input []byte) (string, error) {
	res, err := HelloWorldABI.UnpackInput("setGreeting", input)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	unpacked := *abi.ConvertType(res[0], new(string)).(*string)
	return unpacked, nil
}
```

The ABI is a binary format and the input to the precompile contract function is a
byte array. The `Unpacker` function converts this input to a more easy-to-use format so that we can
use it in our function.

Similarly, there is a `Packer` function for each output of a precompile contract function as follows:

```go
// PackSayHelloOutput attempts to pack given result of type string
// to conform the ABI outputs.
func PackSayHelloOutput(result string) ([]byte, error) {
	return HelloWorldABI.PackOutput("sayHello", result)
}
```

This function converts the output of the function to a byte array that conforms to the ABI and can be
returned to the EVM as a result.

#### Modify sayHello()

The next place to modify is in our `sayHello()` function. In a previous step, we created the `IHelloWorld.sol`
interface with two functions `sayHello()` and `setGreeting()`. We finally get to implement them here.
If any contract calls these functions from the interface, the below function gets executed. This function
is a simple getter function. In `Configure()` we set up a mapping with the key as `storageKey` and
the value as `Hello World!` In this function, we will be returning whatever value is at `storageKey`.
The below code snippet can be copied and pasted to overwrite the default `setGreeting` code.

First, we add a helper function to get the greeting value from the stateDB, this will be helpful
when we test our contract.

```go
// GetGreeting returns the value of the storage key "storageKey" in the contract storage,
// with leading zeroes trimmed.
// This function is mostly used for tests.
func GetGreeting(stateDB contract.StateDB) string {
	// Get the value set at recipient
	value := stateDB.GetState(ContractAddress, storageKeyHash)
	return string(common.TrimLeftZeroes(value.Bytes()))
}
```

Now we can modify the `sayHello` function to return the stored value.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```go
func sayHello(accessibleState contract.AccessibleState, caller common.Address, addr common.Address, input []byte, suppliedGas uint64, readOnly bool) (ret []byte, remainingGas uint64, err error) {
	if remainingGas, err = contract.deductGas(suppliedGas, SayHelloGasCost); err != nil {
		return nil, 0, err
	}
	// CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE

	// Get the current state
	currentState := accessibleState.GetStateDB()
	// Get the value set at recipient
	value := GetGreeting(currentState)
	packedOutput, err := PackSayHelloOutput(value)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, remainingGas, err
	}

	// Return the packed output and the remaining gas
	return packedOutput, remainingGas, nil
}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

#### Modify setGreeting()

We can also modify our `setGreeting()` function. This is a simple setter function. It takes in `input`
and we will set that as the value in the state mapping with the key as `storageKey`. It also checks
if the VM running the precompile is in read-only mode. If it is, it returns an error.

There is also a generated `AllowList` code in that function. This generated code checks if the caller
address is eligible to perform this state-changing operation. If not, it returns an error.

Let's add the helper function to set the greeting value in the stateDB, this will be helpful
when we test our contract.

```go
// StoreGreeting sets the value of the storage key "storageKey" in the contract storage.
func StoreGreeting(stateDB contract.StateDB, input string) {
	inputPadded := common.LeftPadBytes([]byte(input), common.HashLength)
	inputHash := common.BytesToHash(inputPadded)

	stateDB.SetState(ContractAddress, storageKeyHash, inputHash)
}
```

The below code snippet can be copied and pasted to overwrite the default `setGreeting()` code.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```go
func setGreeting(accessibleState contract.AccessibleState, caller common.Address, addr common.Address, input []byte, suppliedGas uint64, readOnly bool) (ret []byte, remainingGas uint64, err error) {
	if remainingGas, err = contract.DeductGas(suppliedGas, SetGreetingGasCost); err != nil {
		return nil, 0, err
	}
	if readOnly {
		return nil, remainingGas, vmerrs.ErrWriteProtection
	}
	// attempts to unpack [input] into the arguments to the SetGreetingInput.
	// Assumes that [input] does not include selector
	// You can use unpacked [inputStruct] variable in your code
	inputStruct, err := UnpackSetGreetingInput(input)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, remainingGas, err
	}

	// Allow list is enabled and SetGreeting is a state-changer function.
	// This part of the code restricts the function to be called only by enabled/admin addresses in the allow list.
	// You can modify/delete this code if you don't want this function to be restricted by the allow list.
	stateDB := accessibleState.GetStateDB()
	// Verify that the caller is in the allow list and therefore has the right to call this function.
	callerStatus := allowlist.GetAllowListStatus(stateDB, ContractAddress, caller)
	if !callerStatus.IsEnabled() {
		return nil, remainingGas, fmt.Errorf("%w: %s", ErrCannotSetGreeting, caller)
	}
	// allow list code ends here.

	// CUSTOM CODE STARTS HERE
	// Check if the input string is longer than HashLength
	if len(inputStruct) > common.HashLength {
		return nil, 0, ErrInputExceedsLimit
	}

	// setGreeting is the execution function
	// "SetGreeting(name string)" and sets the storageKey
	// in the string returned by hello world
	StoreGreeting(stateDB, inputStruct)

	// This function does not return an output, leave this one as is
	packedOutput := []byte{}

	// Return the packed output and the remaining gas
	return packedOutput, remainingGas, nil
}
```

## Setting Gas Costs

Setting gas costs for functions is very important and should be done carefully.
If the gas costs are set too low,
then functions can be abused and can cause DoS attacks.
If the gas costs are set too high, then the contract will be too expensive
to run.
Subnet-EVM has some predefined gas costs for write and read operations
in [`precompile/contract/utils.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/contract/utils.go#L19-L20).
In order to provide a baseline for gas costs, we have set the following gas costs.

```go
// Gas costs for stateful precompiles
const (
	WriteGasCostPerSlot = 20_000
	ReadGasCostPerSlot  = 5_000
)
```

`WriteGasCostPerSlot` is the cost of one write such as modifying a state storage slot.

`ReadGasCostPerSlot` is the cost of reading a state storage slot.

This should be in your gas cost estimations based on how many times the precompile function does a
read or a write. For example, if the precompile modifies the state slot of its precompile address
twice then the gas cost for that function would be `40_000`. However, if the precompile does additional
operations and requires more computational power, then you should increase the gas costs accordingly.

On top of these gas costs, we also have to account for the gas costs of AllowList gas costs. These
are the gas costs of reading and writing permissions for addresses in AllowList. These are defined
under Subnet-EVM's [`precompile/allowlist/allowlist.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/allowlist/allowlist.go#L28-L29).
By default, these are added to the default gas costs of the state-change functions (SetGreeting)
of the precompile. Meaning that these functions will cost an additional `ReadAllowListGasCost` in order
to read permissions from the storage. If you don't plan to read permissions from the storage then
you can omit these.

Now going back to our `/helloworld/contract.go`, we can modify our precompile function gas costs.
Please search (`CTRL F`) `SET A GAS COST HERE` to locate the default gas cost code.

```go
SayHelloGasCost    uint64 = 0                                  // SET A GAS COST HERE
SetGreetingGasCost uint64 = 0 + allowlist.ReadAllowListGasCost // SET A GAS COST HERE
```

We get and set our greeting with `sayHello()` and `setGreeting()` in one slot
respectively so we can define the gas costs as follows. We also read permissions from the
AllowList in `setGreeting()` so we keep `allowlist.ReadAllowListGasCost`.

```go
SayHelloGasCost    uint64 = contract.ReadGasCostPerSlot
SetGreetingGasCost uint64 = contract.WriteGasCostPerSlot + allowlist.ReadAllowListGasCost
```

## Registering Your Precompile

We should register our precompile package to the Subnet-EVM to be discovered by other packages.
Our `Module` file contains an `init()` function that registers our precompile.
`init()` is called when the package is imported.
We should register our precompile in a common package so
that it can be imported by other packages.

<Tabs groupId="evm-tabs">

<TabItem value="subnet-evm-tab" label="Subnet-EVM" default>

For Subnet-EVM we have a precompile registry under [`/precompile/registry/registry.go`](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/precompile/registry/registry.go).
This registry force-imports precompiles from other packages, for example:

```go
// Force imports of each precompile to ensure each precompile's init function runs and registers itself
// with the registry.
import (
	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/deployerallowlist"

	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/nativeminter"

	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/txallowlist"

	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/feemanager"

	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/rewardmanager"

	_ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/helloworld"
	// ADD YOUR PRECOMPILE HERE
	// _ "github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/precompile/contracts/yourprecompile"
)
```

<!-- vale off -->

The registry itself also force-imported by the [`/plugin/evm/vm.go](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/plugin/evm/vm.go#L50).
This ensures that the registry is imported and the precompiles are registered.
