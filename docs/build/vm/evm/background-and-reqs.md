# Background and Requirements

This is a brief overview of what this tutorial will cover.

- Write a Solidity interface
- Generate the precompile template
- Implement the precompile functions in Golang
- Write and run tests

:::caution
Stateful precompiles are [alpha software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha).
Build at your own risk.
:::

In this tutorial, we used a branch based on Subnet-EVM version `v0.5.2`. You can find the branch
[here](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/tree/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2). The code in this
branch is the same as Subnet-EVM except for the `precompile/contracts/helloworld` directory. The
directory contains the code for the `HelloWorld` precompile. We will be using this
precompile as an example to learn how to write a stateful precompile. The code in this branch can become
outdated.
You should always use the latest version of Subnet-EVM when you develop your own precompile.

#### Precompile-EVM

Subnet-EVM precompiles can be registered from an external repo.
This allows developer to build their precompiles without maintaining a fork of Subnet-EVM.
The precompiles are then registered in the Subnet-EVM at build time.

The difference between using Subnet-EVM and Precompile-EVM is that with Subnet-EVM you can change EVM
internals to interact with your precompiles.
Such as changing fee structure, adding new opcodes, changing how to build a block, etc.
With Precompile-EVM you can only add new stateful precompiles that can interact with the StateDB.
Precompiles built with Precompile-EVM are still very powerful because it can directly access to the
state and modify it.

There is a template repo for how to build a precompile with this way called
[Precompile-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm). Both Subnet-EVM and Precompile-EVM share
similar directory structures and common codes.
You can reference the Precompile-EVM PR that adds Hello World precompile [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/pull/2)

### Requirements

This tutorial assumes familiarity with Golang and JavaScript.

Additionally, users should be deeply familiar with the EVM in order to understand its invariants
since adding a Stateful Precompile modifies the EVM itself.

Here are some recommended resources to learn the ins and outs of the EVM:

- [The Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/13evm.asciidoc)
- [Precompiles in Solidity](https://medium.com/@rbkhmrcr/precompiles-solidity-e5d29bd428c4)
- [Deconstructing a Smart Contract](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/deconstructing-a-solidity-contract-part-i-introduction-832efd2d7737/)
- [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/internals/layout_in_storage.html)
- [Layout in Memory](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/internals/layout_in_memory.html)
- [Layout of Call Data](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/internals/layout_in_calldata.html)
- [Contract ABI Specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/abi-spec.html)
- [Customizing the EVM with Stateful Precompiles](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/customizing-the-evm-with-stateful-precompiles-f44a34f39efd)

Please install the following before getting started.

First, install the latest version of Go. Follow the instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).
You can verify by running `go version`.

Set the `$GOPATH` environment variable properly for Go to look for Go Workspaces. Please read
[this](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) for details. You can verify by running `echo $GOPATH`.

:::info
See [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) for instructions on setting the
GOPATH based on system configurations.
:::

As a few things will be installed into `$GOPATH/bin`, please make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your
`$PATH`, otherwise, you may get an error running the commands below.
To do that, run the command: `export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin`

Download the following prerequisites into your `$GOPATH`:

- Git Clone the repository (Subnet-EVM or Precompile-EVM)
- Git Clone [AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) repository
- Install [Avalanche Network Runner](/tooling/network-runner.md)
- Install [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js#usage-on-the-command-line)
- Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  For easy copy paste, use the below commands:

```shell
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/ava-labs
cd src/github.com/ava-labs
```

Clone the repository:

<!-- vale off -->

<Tabs groupId="evm-tabs">
<TabItem value="subnet-evm-tab" label="Subnet-EVM" default>

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ava-labs/subnet-evm.git
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="precompile-evm-tab" label="Precompile-EVM" >

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ava-labs/precompile-evm.git
```

Alternatively you can use it as a template repo from [github](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/generate).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- vale on -->

Then run the following commands:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ava-labs/avalanchego.git
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-network-runner/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
npm install -g solc
```

### Complete Code

You can inspect example pull request for the complete code.
