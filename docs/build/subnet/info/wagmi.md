# WAGMI Subnet

The WAGMI ("We're All Going to Make It") Subnet is a high throughput testbed for EVM (Ethereum
Virtual Machine) optimizations. It is parameterized to run at a factor more capacity than
Fuji/Mainnet C-Chain and will is used to experiment with release candidates before included
in an official Coreth release.

## Overview

This is one of the first cases of using Avalanche Subnets as a proving ground for changes in a
production VM (Coreth). Many underestimate how useful the isolation of Subnets is for performing
complex VM testing on a live network (without impacting the stability of the primary network).

We created a basic WAGMI Explorer [https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi](https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi)
that surfaces aggregated usage statistics about the Subnet.

## Case Study: WAGMI Upgrade

This case study uses [WAGMI](https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi) Subnet upgrade to show how a
network upgrade on an EVM-based (Ethereum Virtual Machine) Subnet can be done simply, and how the
resulting upgrade can be used to dynamically control fee structure on the Subnet.

### Introduction

[Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) aims to provide an easy to use toolbox to
customize the EVM for your blockchain. It is meant to run out of the box for many Subnets without
any modification. But what happens when you want to add a new feature updating the rules of your
EVM?

Instead of hard coding the timing of network upgrades in client code like most EVM chains, requiring
coordinated deployments of new code, [Subnet-EVM
v0.2.8](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/tag/v0.2.8) introduces the long awaited
feature to perform network upgrades by just using a few lines of JSON in a configuration file.

### Network Upgrades: Enable/Disable Precompiles

Detailed description of how to do this can be found in [Customize a Subnet](/build/subnet/upgrade/customize-a-subnet.md#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles) tutorial.
Here's a summary:

- Network Upgrade utilizes existing precompiles on the Subnet-EVM:
  - ContractDeployerAllowList, for restricting smart contract deployers
  - TransactionAllowList, for restricting who can submit transactions
  - NativeMinter, for minting native coins
  - FeeManager, for configuring dynamic fees
- Each of these precompiles can be individually enabled or disabled at a given timestamp as a
  network upgrade, or any of the parameters governing its behavior changed.
- These upgrades must be specified in a file named `upgrade.json` placed in the same directory where
  [`config.json`](/build/subnet/upgrade/customize-a-subnet.md#avalanchego-chain-configs) resides: `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json`.

### Preparation

To prepare for the WAGMI network upgrade, on August 15, 2022, we had announced on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronBuchwald/status/1559249414102720512) and shared on other social
media such as Discord, with the following information:

> With Subnet-EVM v0.2.8 It's time for a whole new Subnet Season: Network Upgrade Edition.
>
> Like every great show, we're kicking this season off with a pilot episode: WAGMI Network Upgrade.
>
> Stay tuned because this pilot is literally a can't miss for every WAGMI node üòâ
>
> The upgrade will activate the fee config manager, and enable smooth fee config updates in the
> future [https://docs.avax.network/subnets/customize-a-subnet#configuring-dynamic-fees](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/customize-a-subnet#configuring-dynamic-fees)
>
> This upgrade changes how blocks are processed on WAGMI, so every WAGMI node needs to upgrade to
> continue to validate WAGMI correctly.
>
> In order to update your node, you need to update to Subnet-EVM v0.2.8 and follow the instructions
> to enable a stateful precompile on Subnet-EVM here:
> [https://docs.avax.network/subnets/customize-a-subnet#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/customize-a-subnet#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles)
>
> You can find the JSON to configure the network upgrade in this gist:
> [https://gist.github.com/aaronbuchwald/b3af9da34678f542ce31717e7963085b]
>
> TLDR; you will need to place the JSON file into your node's file directory within
> `chain-config-dir/wagmi blockchainID/upgrade.json` and restart your node.
>
> Note: the WAGMI blockchainID is 2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt.

### Deploying upgrade.json

The content of the `upgrade.json` is:

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "feeManagerConfig": {
        "adminAddresses": ["0x6f0f6DA1852857d7789f68a28bba866671f3880D"],
        "blockTimestamp": 1660658400
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Detailed explanation of feeManagerConfig can be found in the [precompiles documentation](/build/subnet/upgrade/customize-a-subnet.md#configuring-dynamic-fees).

With the above `upgrade.json`, we intend to change the `adminAddresses` at timestamp `1660658400`:

- `0x6f0f6DA1852857d7789f68a28bba866671f3880D` is named as the new Admin of the FeeManager
- `1660658400` is the [Unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) for 10:00 AM EDT August 16, 2022
  (future time when we made the announcement) when the new FeeManager change would take effect.

We place the `upgrade.json` file in the chain config directory, which in our case is
`~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt/`. After that, we
restart the node so the upgrade file is loaded.

When the node restarts, AvalancheGo reads the contents of the JSON file and passes it into
Subnet-EVM. We see a log of the chain configuration that includes the updated precompile upgrade. It
looks like this:

```text
INFO [08-15|15:09:36.772] <2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt Chain>

Engine: Dummy Consensus Engine}‚Äù
```

We note that `precompileUpgrades` correctly shows the upcoming precompile upgrade. Upgrade is locked
in and ready.

### Activation

When the time passed 10:00 AM EDT August 16, 2022 (Unix timestamp 1660658400), the `upgrade.json` had
been executed as planned and the new FeeManager admin address has been activated. From now on, we
don't need to issue any new code or deploy anything on the WAGMI nodes to change the fee structure.
Let's see how it works in practice!

### Using Fee Manager

The owner `0x6f0f6DA1852857d7789f68a28bba866671f3880D` can now configure the fees on the Subnet as
they see fit. To do that, all that's needed is access to the network, the private key for the newly
set manager address and making calls on the precompiled contract.

We will use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) online Solidity IDE and the [Core Browser
Extension](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6066879-core-extension-how-do-i-add-the-core-extension).
Core comes with WAGMI network built-in. MetaMask will do as well but you will need to [add WAGMI](/build/subnet/info/wagmi.md#adding-wagmi-to-core) yourself.

First using Core, we open the account as the owner `0x6f0f6DA1852857d7789f68a28bba866671f3880D`.

Then we connect Core to WAGMI, Switch on the `Testnet Mode` in `Advanced` page in the hamburger menu:

![Core Testnet mode](/img/network-upgrade/core-testnet-mode.png)

And then open the `Manage Networks` menu in the networks dropdown. Select WAGMI there by clicking
the star icon:

![Core network selection](/img/network-upgrade/core-network-select.png)

We then switch to WAGMI in the networks dropdown. We are ready to move on to Remix now, so we open
it in the browser. First, we check that Remix sees the extension and correctly talks to it. We
select `Deploy & run transactions` icon on the left edge, and on the Environment dropdown, select
`Injected Provider`. We need to approve the Remix network access in the Core browser extension. When
that is done, `Custom (11111) network` is shown:

![Injected provider](/img/network-upgrade/remix-injected-provider.png)

Good, we're talking to WAGMI Subnet. Next we need to load the contracts into Remix. Using 'load from
GitHub' option from the Remix home screen we load two contracts:

- [IAllowList.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IAllowList.sol)
- and
  [IFeeManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/contract/contracts/interfaces/IFeeManager.sol).

IFeeManager is our precompile, but it references the IAllowList, so we need that one as well. We
compile IFeeManager.sol and deploy at the precompile address
`0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003` used on the
[Subnet](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/params.go#L33).

![Deployed contract](/img/network-upgrade/deployed-contract.png)

Now we can interact with the FeeManager precompile from within Remix via Core. For example, we can
use the `getFeeConfig` method to check the current fee configuration. This action can be performed
by anyone as it is just a read operation.

Once we have the new desired configuration for the fees on the Subnet, we can use the `setFeeConfig`
to change the parameters. This action can **only** be performed by the owner
`0x6f0f6DA1852857d7789f68a28bba866671f3880D` as the `adminAddress` specified in the [`upgrade.json` above](#deploying-upgradejson).

![setFeeConfig](/img/network-upgrade/setFeeConfig.png)

When we call that method by pressing the `transact` button, a new transaction is posted to the
Subnet, and we can see it on [the
explorer](https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi/block/0xad95ccf04f6a8e018ece7912939860553363cc23151a0a31ea429ba6e60ad5a3):

![transaction](/img/network-upgrade/wagmi-tx.png)

Immediately after the transaction is accepted, the new fee config takes effect. We can check with
the `getFeeCofig` that the values are reflected in the active fee config (again this action can be
performed by anyone):

![getFeeConfig](/img/network-upgrade/getFeeConfig.png)

That's it, fees changed! No network upgrades, no complex and risky deployments, just making a simple
contract call and the new fee configuration is in place!

### Conclusion

Network upgrades can be complex and perilous procedures to carry out safely. Our continuing efforts
with Subnets is to make upgrades as painless and simple as possible. With the powerful combination
of stateful precompiles and network upgrades via the upgrade configuration files we have managed to
greatly simplify both the network upgrades and network parameter changes. This in turn enables much
safer experimentation and many new use cases that were too risky and complex to carry out with
high-coordination efforts required with the traditional network upgrade mechanisms.

We hope this case study will help spark ideas for new things you may try on your own. We're looking
forward to seeing what you have built and how easy upgrades help you in managing your Subnets! If
you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact us on our
[Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org). Or just reach out to tell us what exciting new things you have
built!
