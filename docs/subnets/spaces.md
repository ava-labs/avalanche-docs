# Spaces: Experimental Implementation

Detailed information about this can be found in the [README of the SpacesVM project](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm#spaces-virtual-machine-spacesvm).

Demo can be found at [tryspaces.xyz](https://tryspaces.xyz/).

Furthermore, we have developed [subnet-cli](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli) which is command-line interface to manage Avalanche Subnets.

In summary, Spaces is an experimental implementation of subnet which includes the following parts:

* SpacesVM => which is new Avalanche-native VM, https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm 
* Spaces => SpacesVM Subnet Demo, https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm-js 
* subnet-cli => subnet command line client  https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli
