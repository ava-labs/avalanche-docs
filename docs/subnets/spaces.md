# Spaces: Experimental Implementation

Detailed information about this can be found in the [README of the SpacesVM project](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm#spaces-virtual-machine-spacesvm).

Demo can be found at [tryspaces.xyz](https://tryspaces.xyz/).

Furthermore, we have developed [Subnet-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli) which is
command-line interface to manage Avalanche Subnets.

In summary, Spaces is an experimental implementation of Subnet which includes the following parts:

- [SpacesVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm) => which is new Avalanche-native VM
- [Spaces](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm-js) => SpacesVM Subnet Demo
- [Subnet-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-cli) => Subnet command-line client
