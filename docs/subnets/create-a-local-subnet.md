# Create an EVM Subnet on a Local Network

To learn how to develop a Subnet, the first step is to create a local Subnet so that you can experience it freely without too much constraints. [Avalanche-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli) provides such a utility.

:::info

Avalanche-CLI is very early in its lifecycle. It will evolve rapidly over the coming weeks and months. Until we achieve our first mature release, we are not committed to preserving backwards compatibility. Commands may be renamed or removed in future versions. Examples and their output may become outdated. Please check this page and [the github project](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli) often and run through the commands to experience them.

:::

## Installation

To download a binary for the latest release, run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The binary will be installed inside the `./` directory (relative to where the install command was run).

:::note
Downloading binaries from the Github UI will cause permission errors when running it the first time on Mac.
:::

To add the binary to your path, run

```bash
cd bin
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
```

To add it to your path permanently, add an export command to your shell initialization script (ex: .bashrc).

### Installing in Custom Location

To download the binary into a specific directory, run:

```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b <relative directory>
```

## Quickstart

After installing, launch your own custom Subnet:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
cd bin
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
avalanche subnet create <subnetName>
avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName>
```

Shut down your local deployment with:

```bash
avalanche network stop
```

Restart your local deployment (from where you left off) with:

```bash
avalanche network start
```

### Docker

To make Avalanche CLI working in a docker, add this

```json
{
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/80"
}
```

to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on the host, then restart the docker service. This is because ipv6 is used to resolve local bootstrap IPs, and it is not enabled on a docker container by default.

### Currently Supported Functionality

- Creation of Subnet-EVM configs
- Local deployment of Subnet-EVM based Subnets

### Notable Missing Features

- Fuji and mainnet Subnet-EVM deploys

## Subnet

The Subnet command suite provides a collection of tools for developing and deploying Subnets.

To get started, use the `avalanche subnet create` command wizard to walk through the configuration of your very first Subnet. Then, go ahead and deploy it with the `avalanche subnet deploy` command. You can use the rest of the commands to manage your subnet configurations.

### Subnet-EVM

Subnet-EVM is a configurable Ethereum virtual machine designed for Subnets. It supports airdrops, custom fee tokens, configurable gas parameters, and multiple stateful precompiles. To learn more, check out the [github project](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm).

### Create a Custom Subnet Configuration

`avalanche subnet create <subnetName>`

If you don't provide any arguments, the Subnet creation wizard will walk you through the entire process. This will create a genesis file for your network. It contains all of the information you need to airdrop tokens, set a gas config, and enable any custom precompiles. You can read more about Subnet configuration [here](./customize-a-subnet.md).

Example:

Command `avalanche subnet create firstsubet` walks through following questions:

- Choose a VM: default to SubnetEVM
- Pick a chain ID
- Set fees: default to Avalanche C-Chain's setting
- Airdrop: default to airdrop 1 million tokens
- Add a custom precompile to modify the EVM: default to no.

The wizard won't customize every aspect of the Subnet-EVM genesis for you. If you'd like complete control, you can specify a custom genesis by providing a path to the file you'd like to use. Run with:

`avalanche subnet create <subnetName> --file <filepath>`

One special note: Every EVM-based chain has a parameter called the `chainId`. When choosing a `chainId` for your network, you should choose a unique value. Check [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) to see if the value you'd like is already in use.

By default, creating a Subnet configuration with the same subnetName as one that already exists will fail. To overwrite an existing config, use the force flag:

`avalanche subnet create <existingSubnetName> -f`

### View Created Subnet Configurations

You can list the Subnets you've created with

`avalanche subnet list`

Example:

```text
> avalanche subnet list
+-------------+-------------+-----------+
|   SUBNET    |    CHAIN    |   TYPE    |
+-------------+-------------+-----------+
| firstsubnet | firstsubnet | SubnetEVM |
+-------------+-------------+-----------+
```

To see the details of a specific configuration, run

`avalanche subnet describe <subnetName>`

Example:

```text
> avalanche subnet describe firstsubnet

### Deploying Subnets Locally

Currently, this tool only supports local Subnet deploys. Fuji and Mainnet deploys will be arriving shortly.

To deploy, run

`avalanche subnet deploy <subnetName>`

Local deploys will start a multi-node Avalanche network in the background on your machine. Progress will be shown until it completes. It also prints info needed for connecting with Metamask.

Example:

```text
> avalanche subnet deploy firstsubnet
✔ Local Network

Network name:     firstsubnet
Chain ID:         12345
Currency Symbol:  TEST
```

To manage that network, see [the `avalanche network` command tree](#network).

### Deploying to Fuji

If you can't wait to for this tool's Fuji integration, you can use the `subnet-cli` tool to deploy your Subnet.

First, export your Subnet's genesis file with `avalanche subnet describe --genesis <subnetName>`. Then, use that genesis file to complete the instructions listed [here](./create-a-fuji-subnet.md#run-subnet-cli-wizard).

### Delete a Subnet Configuration

To delete a created Subnet configuration, run

`avalanche subnet delete <subnetName>`

## Network

The network command suite provides a collection of tools for managing local Subnet deployments.

When a Subnet is deployed locally, it runs on a local, multi-node Avalanche network. Deploying a Subnet locally will start this network in the background. This command suite allows you to shutdown and restart that network.

This network currently supports multiple, concurrently deployed Subnets and will eventually support nodes with varying configurations. Expect more functionality in future releases.

### Stopping the Local Network

To stop a running local network, run

`avalanche network stop [snapshotName]`

This graceful shutdown will preserve network state. When restarted, your Subnet should resume at the same place it left off.
`snapshotName` is optional, if provided, a named snapshot will be created which can later be started again with `avalanche network start snapshotName`.
If not provided, a default snapshot will be created. The default snapshot will be overwritten at each `stop`.

Example:

```text
> avalanche network stop
dialing endpoint ":8097"
Network stopped successfully.
```

### Starting/Restarting the Local Network

To start or restart a stopped network, run

`avalanche network start [snapshotName]`

`snapshotName` is optional, if provided the named snapshot will be used to start the network (if found).
If not provided, the last snapshot created with a unnamed `stop` will be used.

If the default snapshot doesn't exist (because no `stop` has been run yet, and/or no Subnet has been deployed yet), the command will fail.

Deploying a Subnet locally will start the network automatically.

Example:

```text
> avalanche network start
dialing endpoint ":8097"
Starting previously deployed and stopped snapshot

```

### Deleting the Local Network

To stop your local network and clear its state, run

`avalanche network clean`

This will delete all stored deploy state for all local Subnet deployments. This will not delete any of your Subnet configurations. You will need to redeploy your Subnet configurations one by one to use them again.

Example:

```text
> avalanche network clean
dialing endpoint ":8097"
Process terminated.
```

### Checking Network Status

If you'd like to determine whether or not a local Avalanche network is running on your machine, run

`avalanche network status`

## Connect with Metamask

Please use the value provided by `Metamask connection details` to connect with Metamask.

```text
Metamask connection details (any node URL from above works):
RPC URL:          http://127.0.0.1:63196/ext/bc/2GAinA2PAEEEnuy1yTeqgqCbQWUGFTvUaiDSRiZgMrRRoLYs92/rpc
Funded address:   0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC with 1000000 (10^18) - private key: 56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027
Network name:     firstsubnet
Chain ID:         12345
Currency Symbol:  TEST
```

You can create a new metamask account by importing the private key `0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027` and start experiencing with this account.

Here is a screenshot of Metamask when everything is set correctly:
![Avalanche CLI Metamask](/img/avalanche-cli-metamask.png)

## Smart Contract

You can use this newly created Subnet just like you use C-Chain and EVM tools. Only differences are `chainID` and RPC URL. For example you can follow this article to [Deploy a Smart Contract on Your Subnet EVM Using Remix and Metamask](./deploy-a-smart-contract-on-your-evm.md). Or you can deploy your contracts with [hardhat quick start guide](../dapps/smart-contracts/using-hardhat-with-the-avalanche-c-chain.md) by changing `url` and `chainId` in the `hardhat.config.ts`.

For example: to connect `Hardhat` to the local network that deployed with the Avalanche-CLI, we would create a network setting in `hardhat.config.ts` that looks similar to this:

```json
testChain: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:63196/ext/bc/2GAinA2PAEEEnuy1yTeqgqCbQWUGFTvUaiDSRiZgMrRRoLYs92/rpc",
      chainId: 12345,
      accounts: ["<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE>"],
    }
```

## Next Step

After you feel comfortable moving forward, you should try it on the Fuji Testnet by following [this tutorial](./create-a-fuji-subnet.md).
