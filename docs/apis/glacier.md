# Glacier API

The Glacier API is a performant API that allows web3 developers to more easily
access the indexed blockchain data they need to build powerful applications on
top of Avalanche's primary and subnetworks as well as Ethereum.

By leveraging Glacier, developers can:

- Retrieve native and ERC-20 token balances and associated pricing information
- Get details related to blocks, transactions and UTXOs
- Retrieve digital collectible (ERC-721/1155) balances and metadata
- Get native asset and token transfer history
