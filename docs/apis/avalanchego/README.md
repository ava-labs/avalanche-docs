# AvalancheGo Overview

[**APIs**](./apis/README.md): all APIs provided by AvalancheGo server software.

[**Public API Server**](public-api-server.md): the public API server you can use to
interact with the Avalanche Network.

[**Postman Collection**](postman-avalanche-collection.md): an AvalancheGo API template and environment
collection for [Postman](https://postman.com/), a tool to simplify API development and experimentation.
The collection covers all of AvalancheGo APIs, so you can easily issue commands to a node and examine
the output in a nicely formatted, readable way.

[**Release Notes**](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases): the latest release notes on GitHub.
