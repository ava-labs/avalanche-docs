## v1.4.12 ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.4.12))

This update is backwards compatible. It is optional, but encouraged.

**X-Chain**

- Added formatting argument `"json"` to API method `GetTx`, which returns the JSON representation of the queried transaction
- Added interface type assertions

**Info API**

- Added method `GetNodeVersion` to Info API client

**Prometheus Metrics**

- Fixed and renamed metrics for bytes not sent due to compression
- Added metrics for bytes not received due to compression
- Added helper struct `noAverager` to `metrics` package

**Database**

- Updated/added benchmarks

**Shared Memory**

- Replace `Put` and `Remove` with `Apply` to allow for future atomic transaction optimization

## v1.4.11 ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.4.11))

**C-Chain**

This release enables snapshots by default.

**Config Flags**

_Removed_

- `conn-meter-reset-duration`
- `conn-meter-max-conns`

_Added_

- `network-compression-enabled`

**Prometheus Metrics**

Many Prometheus metrics were renamed, and many histograms were replaced with 2 gauges. See [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-monitoring/tree/master/grafana/dashboards) for updated Grafana Dashboards.

This release also adds helper methods to the `utils/metric` package.

**RocksDB**

RocksDB is no longer built by default when running the build script, and it is not included in publicly released binaries. To build AvalancheGo with RocksDB, run `export ROCKSDBALLOWED=1` in your terminal and then `scripts/build.sh`. You must do this before you can use `--db-type=rocksdb`.

The RocksDB database now places/looks for its files in a subdirectory `rocksdb`. Note that if you previously ran with RocksDB, you'll need to move the existing files.

**Message Compression**

Nodes now compress some P2P messages. If a peer is version &gt;= v1.4.11, Put, Push Query, Peer List and Multiput messages sent to the peer are compressed using gzip before being sent over the network. This reduces AvalancheGo's bandwidth usage.

**Inbound Connection Throttling** Refactored inbound connection rate-limiting and enable it by default.

**General Improvements**

- Refactored and improved performance of iteration over a database served by gRPC to a plugin.
- On Linux, clean up the C-Chain if AvalancheGo dies ungracefully
- Refactored P2P message definitions and move them from the `network` package.
- Added VM aliases to the HTTP API server
- Replaced `1024` with `units.KiB`, etc.

**Apricot Phase 2 - Patch 7**

:::caution
This update is backwards compatible. It is optional, but encouraged. The patch includes performance improvements and bug fixes.
:::

If the previously installed node version is &lt;= v1.4.4 then this node may have stopped processing blocks. This update will repair the node and perform a database migration. If the previously installed node version is &gt;=v1.4.5 then this node will use the existing database and does not need to perform a database migration.

- Fixed the pre-migration node to correctly verify the P-chain block `SHraz7TtMfTQ5DX1rREhNZW1bi7PpPzAq7xoJAwrWNQrLhQcD`.

- Fixed the build-dir flag to be able to be specified via CLI without causing the preupgrade node to error.
- Removed the plugin-dir flag that is no longer supported with the node-manager daemon. Typically not specifying the flag leads to the correct behavior. However, for complex installations the build-dir flag may be required.
- Enforced gossiping messages only to connections that have finished the peer handshake.
- Reduced memory allocations during consensus traversals and bootstrapping.

## v1.4.5 ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.4.5))

**Apricot Phase 2 - Patch 5 - DB Upgrade**

**This upgrade is more involved than the typical version update.**

:::caution
This update is backwards compatible. It is optional, but encouraged. The patch includes significant performance improvements and numerous other updates.
:::

**VM Improvements:**

- Fully redesigned the `platformvm`'s state management.
  - Removed the usage of `versiondb`s being passed through blocks to pass state references that can be modified and read without re-parsing objects.
  - Implemented a base state manager to properly cache and mange writes to the underlying database.
  - Implemented CoW validator sets to enable caching multiple validator sets in memory.
  - Indexed chains by Subnet to avoid touching unused state objects.
  - Indexed validators by `nodeID` to avoid unnecessary iterations while accepting `addDelegator` and `addSubnetValidator` transactions.
  - Reduced the number of key-value pairs dedicated to managing validator sets on disk and validator uptimes.
- Added staking reward look-ups to the `platformvm`'s API to support indexing of rewards.
- Refactored validator uptime metering to simplify testing.
- Added block and transaction type metrics to the `platformvm`.
- Added API call metrics to the `avm` and the `platformvm`.
- Updated the `avm`'s state management to use `prefixdb`s, record caching metrics, and share additional code with the `platformvm`.
- Simplified `UTXO` management and indexing in the `avm` and `platformvm`.
- Restructured address parsing and management to be fully shared across compatible VM instances.
- Restructured shared memory of the primary Subnet to be fully shared across VM instances.
- Added a chain state implementation to support seamless caching over existing VM implementations and to simplify the implementation of new VMs.
- Integrated the new chain state manager into the `rpcchainvm`, which also adds various metrics.
- Added `upgradeBytes` and `configBytes` to the standard VM interface to better support future network upgrades.
- Added `getAtomicTx` and `getAtomicTxStatus` endpoints to the `evm` API.
- Simplified `evm` block production to be synchronously performed with the consensus engine.
- Added an atomic transaction mempool to re-introduce orphaned atomic transactions.
- Fixed bug in the `evm` client to properly set the `sourceChain` in `getAtomicUTXOs`.
- Integrated the new chain state manager into the `evm` to better optimize block management.

**Bootstrapping Improvements:**

- Removed re-traversals during bootstrapping. This significantly improves the performance of the node during restarts of the bootstrapping process.
- Fixed an ungraceful node shutdown when attempting to exit the node while executing bootstrapped containers.
- Fixed duplicated IPC container broadcasts during bootstrapping.
- Standardized the bootstrapping jobs queue to write to state using `prefixdb`s rather than implementing custom prefixing.
- Added additional bootstrapping caching and cache metrics.

**Database Migration Additions:**

- Added a daemon process manager to seamlessly migrate to the updated database format.
- Refactored version handling to track database semantic versions.
- Implemented a database manager to track and operate over different database versions.
- Implemented a `keystore` migration that automatically copies users from the `v1.0.0` database to the `v1.4.5` database.
- Implemented a validator uptime migration from the `v1.0.0` database to the `v1.4.5` database.

**Node Improvements:**

- Updating config parsing to always expand environment variables.
- Refactored the node config to allow specifying TLS certificates in memory without touching disk.
- Added better support for meaningful exit codes.
- Displayed listening address of the `http` and `staking` servers to aid in supporting non-specific port mappings.
- Implemented a `versionable` database to be able to toggle between a pass through database and a `versioned` database.
- Optimized ID `Set` pre-allocations and reduced the memory usage of the `struct`s.
- Enforced stricter linting rules.

**Modified command line arguments:**

For the following arguments `"default"` was previously treated as a keyword. Now, `"default"` will attempt to be treated as the intended value of the flag. To retain the default behavior, the flag should not be specified.

- `config-file`
- `coreth-config`
- `plugin-dir`
- `staking-tls-key-file`
- `staking-tls-cert-file`
- `bootstrap-ips`
- `bootstrap-ids`
- `ipcs-path`
- `db-dir`

For the following arguments `""` was previously treated as a keyword. Now, `""` will attempt to be treated as the intended value of the flag. To retain the default behavior, the flag should not be specified.

- `ipcs-chain-ids`
- `log-dir`
- `log-display-level`

It is no longer required that the `bootstrap-ips` and `bootstrap-ids` are paired. This means it is now valid to specify a different number of `bootstrap-ips` than `bootstrap-ids`. The `bootstrap-ips` are used to initially connect to the network and the `bootstrap-ids` are used as the beacons in bootstrapping.

**Added command line arguments:**

- `fetch-only`
- `build-dir`

**Removed command line arguments:**

- `xput-server-port`
- `xput-server-enabled`

- Restricted the number of version messages to be sent to a peer to one.
- Removed legacy handshake messages that were deprecated in Apricot Phase 2.
- Marked nodes that have been benched as being offline for uptime calculations.

- Set golang requirement to v1.15.5 to avoid a DoS vulnerability found in the golang standard lib.
- Added API clients to act as helpers interacting with the node software.
- Enabled falling back to bootstrapping if a node becomes disconnected from the rest of the network.
- Fixed the GetUTXOs APIs when UTXOs referenced multiple addresses.
- Refactored binary encoding to better generalize RPC options.
- Fixed IP block filtering to correctly set the window length.
- Generalized the codec package to be able to manage multiple codecs with different versions.
- Added Epoch to the Vertex interface in preparation of a future release.
- Deferred transaction hashing to reduce CPU/Memory utilization past fast checks.
- For those using [https://explorerapi.avax-dev.network/](https://explorerapi.avax-dev.network/), the URL is going to be shut down in a future release. Please switch over to [https://explorerapi.avax.network/](https://explorerapi.avax.network/).

## v1.0.5 ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.0.5))

:::danger
Please note that the release after this one, v1.0.6, will contain the breaking changes. Namely, the response format of `platform.getTxStatus` and `platform.getCurrentValidators` will change.
:::

The changes in this release, v1.0.5, are backwards compatible with previous releases. The update is optional but encouraged. The patch includes performance improvements and some quality of life improvements.

- Added `IssueTx` and `GetUTXOs` to the C-chain API to enable issuing atomic swaps without revealing private keys to a node.
- Fixed memory leak in the snowman request manager with oracle block processing.
- Fix UTXO pagination bug that under-reported available funds.
- Moved chain http logs to live in the human-readable chain logs folder.
- Restructure how IDs are managed to avoid heap allocations.
- Optimized the `UniformSampler`s to avoid creating multiple maps.
- Reduced usage of `ids.Set` in favor of `[]ids.ID` to better utilize continuous memory.
- Introduced `[]byte` reuse in `PrefixDB`.
- Implemented type-specific sorting functions to avoid frequent interface conversion allocations.
- Optimized AVM load user to avoid reading unnecessary information from disk.
- Removed a memory allocation + copy in socket sending for the full length of the message.

## v1.0.4 ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.0.4))

:::danger
This update is optional but encouraged. The patch includes quality of life improvements and various performance enhancements. Note that this update requires the CLI parameters to be specified with -- rather than allowing for either - or --. For example, `-public-ip=127.0.0.1` is no longer allowed and must be specified as `--public-ip=127.0.0.1`. Otherwise, this update is backwards compatible.
:::

```text
• Added Subnet whitelisting to allow a node owner to choose which Subnets to validate.
```

```text
• Added config file parsing for node settings.
• Added more options for specifying a node's IP address and added getNodeIP to the info *endpoint.
• Added a TxID to the result of get.Validators in the platformvm.
• Updated Coreth version.
• Cleaned up the snowball trie implementation and added additional tests to align with mutation tests.
• Implemented and optimized continuous time averages for tracking CPU and network latency.
• Significantly optimized memory allocations in various locations.
• Increased the signature verification cache size.
• Reduced DB reads during vertex management.
```

```text
• Added an optional argument includeReason to platform.getTxStatus.
If not provided, or if false, the output from getTxStatus is the same as before.

For example:
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "Dropped",
    "id": 1
}

If includeReason is true, the output from getTxStatus has a new format. It's an object that looks like this:

{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "status":"[Status]",
        "reason":"[Reason tx was dropped, if applicable]"
    },
    "id": 1
}

In this new format, reason will not be present unless the status is Dropped.
Anything that depends on platform.getTxStatus should switch to using the includeReason argument and use the new response format. After a few releases, we'll only support the new response format.
