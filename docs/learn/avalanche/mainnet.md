# Avalanche Mainnet

The Avalanche Mainnet refers to the main network of the Avalanche blockchain where real transactions
and smart contract executions occur. It is the final and production-ready version of the
blockchain where users can interact with the network and transact with real world assets.

A _network of networks_, Avalanche Mainnet includes the 
[Primary Network](/learn/avalanche/avalanche-platform.md)
formed by the X, P, and C-Chain, as well as all in-production 
[Subnets](/learn/avalanche/subnets-overview.md). These Subnets are independent blockchain sub-networks
that can be tailored to specific application use cases, use their own consensus mechanisms, define
their own token economics, and be run by different [virtual machines](/learn/avalanche/virtual-machines.md).
