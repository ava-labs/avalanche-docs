# What Is Avalanche?

Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications in one
interoperable, decentralized, and highly scalable ecosystem. Powered by a uniquely powerful consensus
mechanism, Avalanche is the first ecosystem designed to accommodate the scale of global finance, with
near-instant transaction finality. 

## Why Choose Avalanche?

### Blazingly Fast

- Avalanche employs the fastest consensus mechanism of any layer1 blockchain. The unique consensus
mechanism enables quick finality and low latency: in less than 2 seconds, your transaction is
effectively processed and verified.

### Built to Scale

- Anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 transactions are confirmed per second, virtually unaffected by network
traffic thanks to the resiliency of Avalanche Consensus. 
- Avalanche is incredibly energy-efficient and can run easily on consumer-grade hardware.
The entire Avalanche network consumes the same amount of energy as 46 US households, equivalent to
0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin.

### Elastic Composability

- Developers who build on Avalanche can build application-specific blockchains with complex rulesets
or build on existing private or public Subnets in any language. 
- Solidity developers can build on Avalanche's implementation of the EVM straight out-of-the box, or
build their own custom Virtual Machine (VM) for advanced use cases.

### Advanced Security

- Avalanche consensus offers stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other
networks.
- Permissionless and permissioned custom blockchains deployed as an Avalanche Subnets can include custom
implementations designed to be compliant with legal and jurisdictional considerations.
