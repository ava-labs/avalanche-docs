# Documentation of Third-Party Tooling Policy

## Introduction

Ava Labs strives to provide developers with comprehensive and streamlined documentation for 
integrating their applications with the Avalanche Blockchain. To ensure clarity and simplicity, we 
have established a policy regarding the inclusion of third-party service provider documentation in 
our developer resources. This policy maintains the focus, accuracy, and reliability of our 
documentation while acknowledging major advancements and prominent adoptions within the web3 
technology ecosystem.

## Policy Statement

Effective immediately, the developer documentation will no longer accept requests to add 
tutorials or extensive explanations on third-party/external technologies or services, unless 
exceptional circumstances warrant their inclusion. This decision address several key concerns:

### 1. Clutter and Complexity

Over time, the inclusion of third-party documentation has led to a cluttered and convoluted
experience for developers seeking information specifically related to Avalanche integration. The
vast array of web3 technologies and services available often results in deprecated or less relevant
content persisting in our documentation. By removing these extensive explanations, we can 
streamline the information, providing developers with clear and concise guidance on integrating 
their applications with Avalanche.

### 2. Maintenance and Accuracy

Keeping up with the constant changes and updates in the web3 technology landscape is a daunting 
task. As a result, maintaining comprehensive and accurate documentation for third-party technologies
can be challenging. By focusing on Avalanche-specific integration materials, we can ensure that our 
documentation remains accurate and up-to-date, providing developers with reliable information that 
they can trust.

### 3. Consistency and Coherence

A coherent and consistent developer experience is crucial for fostering adoption and minimizing 
confusion. Integrating numerous third-party technologies into our core documentation can lead to 
inconsistencies in style, tone, and format. By maintaining a clear separation between Avalanche 
integration materials and third-party technologies, we can provide developers with a cohesive 
experience tailored specifically to Avalanche integration.

## Exceptions

While our general policy excludes third-party documentation from our core developer resources, we 
recognize the importance of acknowledging major advancements and prominent adoptions within the 
web3 technology ecosystem. In exceptional situations, when a third-party technology or service 
demonstrates a majorly prominent adoption and is widely recognized as a standard within 
the industry, we may provide a dedicated page with a brief description or a link to the official 
documentation or relevant resources for that technology.

Our documentation team evaluates these exceptions on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration
factors such as market share, community adoption, and overall impact on the Avalanche ecosystem.

## Conclusion

By implementing this policy, we aim to create a focused and reliable developer documentation 
resource for integrating applications with the Avalanche Blockchain. We believe that by providing 
developers with clear and concise information specific to Avalanche integration, we can enhance the 
overall development experience and promote widespread adoption of the platform. We appreciate your 
understanding and cooperation as we strive to continuously improve our documentation to better 
serve the needs of the developer community.

Thank you for your continued support and involvement in the Avalanche ecosystem.
