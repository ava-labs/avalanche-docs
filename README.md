# Avalanche Docs

## Overview

This repo contains the contents for our docs deployed [here](https://docs.avax.network).

The website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Contributing

Contributing to the docs site is a great way to get involved with the Avalanche dev community! Here's some things you need to know to get started.

### Contents

- All the doc text are located in the [docs](docs) directory; image files are put under [static/img](static/img) directory where a sub-dir is strongly recommended if there are multiple image files for a doc.
- The left sidebar of the page is controlled by [sidebars.js](sidebars.js).
- Style Guide can be found [here](style-guide.md).
- Extensive docs for Docusaurus can be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

### Pull Request (PR)

- All PRs should be made against the `master` branch.
- Following a successful build, Cloudflare Pages will comment on the PR with a link to \*.avalanche-docs.pages.dev where you can verify your changes.
- Once your PR is merged into `master`, [https://docs.avax.network/](https://docs.avax.network/) will be updated with your changes.

### Installation

```zsh
yarn
```

### Local Development

```zsh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```zsh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

**Please make sure that you run this command to see if there is any error in building the package, and fix them before pushing your changes.**
