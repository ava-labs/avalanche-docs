repository. Simply:

- Find the page you want to edit.

### New Content or Extensive Changes

To propose new docs or large edits to our existing pages, follow the steps accordingly:

- **Ava Labs Github Organization Members:** Clone the repo
  `git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs.git`
- **External Contributors:** Fork the repo via GitHub's GUI
- Checkout to a new branch `git checkout -b <your-name/branch-name>`
- Make changes on your branch
- `git add .`
- **`yarn dev` to ensure the build passes**
- `git commit -m "some commit message"`
- `git push`
- Head to [GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs) and open a new pull request

### Structure and Syntax

- Docs are located in the [docs](content/docs) directory.
- Our style guide can be found [here](style-guide.md).
- All image files should be included under [public images folder](public/images).

### Pull Request (PR)

- All PRs should be made against the `master` branch.
- Following a successful build, Vercel will deploy your branch where you can verify your changes.
- Once your PR is merged into `master`, [https://docs.avax.network/](https://docs.avax.network/) will be updated with your changes.

### Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```bash
yarn run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are
reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
next build
```

This command generates static content into the `.next` directory and can be rendered using Next server.
