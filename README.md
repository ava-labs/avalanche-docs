### New Content or Extensive Changes

To propose new docs or large edits to our existing pages, follow the steps accordingly:

- **Ava Labs Github Organization Members:** Clone the repo

- **External Contributors:** Fork the repo via GitHub's GUI
- Checkout to a new branch `git checkout -b <your-name/branch-name>`
- Make changes on your branch

  and open a new pull request

### Structure and Syntax

- Docs are located in the [docs](docs) directory. A document's path corresponds
  with it's domain extension. For example: the guide showing how to
  [Run an Avalanche Node Manually](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/run/node-manually)
  is located in this repository at `docs/nodes/run/node-manually`, and is hosted at
  [https://docs.avax.network/nodes/run/node-manually](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/run/node-manually).
- The left sidebar of the page is controlled primarily by
  [sidebars.json](sidebars.json), where sub-sections are sometimes ordered by their
  [`sidebar_position` metadata field](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#sidebar_position).
- Our style guide can be found [here](style-guide.md).
- This repository uses a series of style checking, linting, and formatting tools. See
  [style-checker-notes.md](style-checker-notes.md) for more details and how to fix errors.
- All image files should be included under
  [static/img/<corresponding-sub-drectory>](static/img).
- Extensive docs for Docusaurus can be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

### Pull Request (PR)

- All PRs should be made against the `master` branch.
- Following a successful build, Cloudflare Pages will comment on the PR with a link to
  \*.avalanche-docs.pages.dev where you can verify your changes.
- Once your PR is merged into `master`, [https://docs.avax.network/](https://docs.avax.network/)
  will be updated with your changes.
