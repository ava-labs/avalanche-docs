This control ensures that only vetted and authorized parties can interact with the blockchain, thereby preventing unauthorized or potentially illicit activities. By restricting access, institutions can implement necessary measures such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols, thereby adhering to industry-specific regulations and maintaining the integrity and security of their blockchain systems.",

      "hint": "Maintaining a hard cap involves restricting the ability to mint new tokens.",
      "explanation": "To maintain a hard cap on the native token supply, a community running an Avalanche L1 blockchain should keep the Native Minter Precompile deactivated. By doing so, they prevent the creation of additional native tokens beyond the predefined limit. This ensures that the total supply remains fixed, which is essential for scenarios where a valueless gas token or a specific tokenomics structure is required. The Native Minter Precompile is deactivated by default, allowing blockchain creators to choose whether to enable or disable minting based on their economic models and requirements.",
