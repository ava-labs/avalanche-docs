Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity
hardware. Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may
change.

-   CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
-   RAM: 16 GiB
-   Storage: 1 TiB SSD
-   OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

:::caution

Please do not try running a node on an HDD, as you may get poor and random 
read/write latencies, therefore reducing performance and reliability.
