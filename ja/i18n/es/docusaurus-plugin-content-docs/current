:::info

As you see, we have used `process.env.<..._PRIVATE_KEY>`. Reason behind that is we do not want to expose our private keys inside our code. To install the related package run:

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

Then, at the root of the project create a file named `.env`. Afterwards put in the private keys of your accounts as follows:

```text
BRIDGE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key-for-admin>
BRIDGE_USER_PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key-for-user>
```

- Make sure that both accounts are funded on both chains so that they can send transactions.
- Make sure that `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file so that you do not upload this file to git.
