description: Learn about the Avalanche Mainnet.

The Avalanche Mainnet refers to the main network of the Avalanche blockchain where real transactions and smart contract executions occur. It is the final and production-ready version of the blockchain where users can interact with the network and transact with real world assets.

A _network of networks_, Avalanche Mainnet includes the [Primary Network](/docs/learn/primary-network) formed by the X, P, and C-Chain, as well as all in-production [Subnets](/docs/learn/subnets).

These Subnets are independent blockchain sub-networks that can be tailored to specific application use cases, use their own consensus mechanisms, define their own token economics, and be run by different [virtual machines](/docs/learn/virtual-machines).
