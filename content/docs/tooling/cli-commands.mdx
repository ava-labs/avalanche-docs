To get started, look at the documentation for the subcommands or jump right in with 
```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain
```

## avalanche blockchain

The blockchain command suite provides a collection of tools for developing
and deploying Blockchains.

To get started, use the blockchain create command wizard to walk through the
configuration of your very first Blockchain. Then, go ahead and deploy it
with the blockchain deploy command. You can use the rest of the commands to
manage your Blockchain configurations and live deployments.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche blockchain [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
-h, --help help             for blockchain
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

**Subcommands:**

- [`addValidator`](#addvalidator): The blockchain addValidator command adds a node as a validator to
an L1 of the user provided deployed network. If the network is proof of 
authority, the owner of the validator manager contract must sign the 
transaction. If the network is proof of stake, the node must stake the L1's
staking token. Both processes will issue a RegisterL1ValidatorTx on the P-Chain.

This command currently only works on Blockchains deployed to either the Fuji
Testnet or Mainnet.
- [`changeOwner`](#changeowner): The blockchain changeOwner changes the owner of the subnet of the deployed Blockchain.
- [`changeWeight`](#changeweight): The blockchain changeWeight command changes the weight of a Subnet Validator.

The Subnet has to be a Proof of Authority Subnet-Only Validator Subnet.
- [`configure`](#configure): AvalancheGo nodes support several different configuration files. Subnets have their own
Subnet config which applies to all chains/VMs in the Subnet. Each chain within the Subnet
can have its own chain config. A chain can also have special requirements for the AvalancheGo node 
configuration itself. This command allows you to set all those files.
- [`create`](#create): The blockchain create command builds a new genesis file to configure your Blockchain.
By default, the command runs an interactive wizard. It walks you through
all the steps you need to create your first Blockchain.

The tool supports deploying Subnet-EVM, and custom VMs. You
can create a custom, user-generated genesis with a custom VM by providing
the path to your genesis and VM binaries with the --genesis and --vm flags.

By default, running the command with a blockchainName that already exists
causes the command to fail. If you'd like to overwrite an existing
configuration, pass the -f flag.
- [`delete`](#delete): The blockchain delete command deletes an existing blockchain configuration.
- [`deploy`](#deploy): The blockchain deploy command deploys your Blockchain configuration locally, to Fuji Testnet, or to Mainnet.

At the end of the call, the command prints the RPC URL you can use to interact with the Subnet.

Avalanche-CLI only supports deploying an individual Blockchain once per network. Subsequent
attempts to deploy the same Blockchain to the same network (local, Fuji, Mainnet) aren't
allowed. If you'd like to redeploy a Blockchain locally for testing, you must first call
avalanche network clean to reset all deployed chain state. Subsequent local deploys
redeploy the chain with fresh state. You can deploy the same Blockchain to multiple networks,
so you can take your locally tested Subnet and deploy it on Fuji or Mainnet.
- [`describe`](#describe): The blockchain describe command prints the details of a Blockchain configuration to the console.
By default, the command prints a summary of the configuration. By providing the --genesis
flag, the command instead prints out the raw genesis file.
- [`export`](#export): The blockchain export command write the details of an existing Blockchain deploy to a file.

The command prompts for an output path. You can also provide one with
the --output flag.
- [`import`](#import): Import blockchain configurations into cli.

This command suite supports importing from a file created on another computer,
or importing from blockchains running public networks
(e.g. created manually or with the deprecated subnet-cli)
- [`join`](#join): The subnet join command configures your validator node to begin validating a new Blockchain.

To complete this process, you must have access to the machine running your validator. If the
Avalanche-CLI is running on the same machine as your validator, it can generate or update your node's
config file automatically. Alternatively, the command can print the necessary instructions
to update your node manually. To complete the validation process, the Subnet's admins must add
the NodeID of your validator to the Subnet's allow list by calling addValidator with your
NodeID.

After you update your validator's config, you need to restart your validator manually. If
you provide the --avalanchego-config flag, this command attempts to edit the config file
at that path.

This command currently only supports Blockchains deployed on the Fuji Testnet and Mainnet.
- [`list`](#list): The blockchain list command prints the names of all created Blockchain configurations. Without any flags,
it prints some general, static information about the Blockchain. With the --deployed flag, the command
shows additional information including the VMID, BlockchainID and SubnetID.
- [`publish`](#publish): The blockchain publish command publishes the Blockchain's VM to a repository.
- [`removeValidator`](#removevalidator): The blockchain removeValidator command stops a whitelisted, subnet network validator from
validating your deployed Blockchain.

To remove the validator from the Subnet's allow list, provide the validator's unique NodeID. You can bypass
these prompts by providing the values with flags.
- [`stats`](#stats): The blockchain stats command prints validator statistics for the given Blockchain.
- [`upgrade`](#upgrade): The blockchain upgrade command suite provides a collection of tools for
updating your developmental and deployed Blockchains.
- [`validators`](#validators): The blockchain validators command lists the validators of a blockchain's subnet and provides
several statistics about them.
- [`vmid`](#vmid): The blockchain vmid command prints the virtual machine ID (VMID) for the given Blockchain.

### addValidator

The blockchain addValidator command adds a node as a validator to
an L1 of the user provided deployed network. If the network is proof of 
authority, the owner of the validator manager contract must sign the 
transaction. If the network is proof of stake, the node must stake the L1's
staking token. Both processes will issue a RegisterL1ValidatorTx on the P-Chain.

This command currently only works on Blockchains deployed to either the Fuji
Testnet or Mainnet.

```

**Subcommands:**

- [`file`](#import-file): The blockchain import command will import a blockchain configuration from a file or a git repository.

To import from a file, you can optionally provide the path as a command-line argument.
Alternatively, running the command without any arguments triggers an interactive wizard.
To import from a repository, go through the wizard. By default, an imported Blockchain doesn't 
overwrite an existing Blockchain with the same name. To allow overwrites, provide the --force
flag.
- [`public`](#import-public): The blockchain import public command imports a Blockchain configuration from a running network.

By default, an imported Blockchain
doesn't overwrite an existing Blockchain with the same name. To allow overwrites, provide the --force
flag.

#### import file

### join

The subnet join command configures your validator node to begin validating a new Blockchain.

To complete this process, you must have access to the machine running your validator. If the
Avalanche-CLI is running on the same machine as your validator, it can generate or update your node's
config file automatically. Alternatively, the command can print the necessary instructions
to update your node manually. To complete the validation process, the Subnet's admins must add
the NodeID of your validator to the Subnet's allow list by calling addValidator with your
NodeID.

After you update your validator's config, you need to restart your validator manually. If
you provide the --avalanchego-config flag, this command attempts to edit the config file
at that path.

This command currently only supports Blockchains deployed on the Fuji Testnet and Mainnet.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche blockchain join [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash

it prints some general, static information about the Blockchain. With the --deployed flag, the command
shows additional information including the VMID, BlockchainID and SubnetID.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche blockchain list [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
--deployed show             additional deploy information
-h, --help help             for list
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

### publish

The blockchain publish command publishes the Blockchain's VM to a repository.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche blockchain publish [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
--alias string               We publish to a remote repo, but identify the repo locally under a user-provided alias (e.g. myrepo).

## avalanche key

The key command suite provides a collection of tools for creating and managing
signing keys. You can use these keys to deploy Subnets to the Fuji Testnet,
but these keys are NOT suitable to use in production environments. DO NOT use
these keys on Mainnet.

To get started, use the key create command.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche key [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
-h, --help help             for key
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

**Subcommands:**

- [`create`](#create): The key create command generates a new private key to use for creating and controlling
test Subnets. Keys generated by this command are NOT cryptographically secure enough to
use in production environments. DO NOT use these keys on Mainnet.

The command works by generating a secp256 key and storing it with the provided keyName. You
can use this key in other commands by providing this keyName.

If you'd like to import an existing key instead of generating one from scratch, provide the
--file flag.
- [`delete`](#delete): The key delete command deletes an existing signing key.

To delete a key, provide the keyName. The command prompts for confirmation
before deleting the key. To skip the confirmation, provide the --force flag.
- [`export`](#export): The key export command exports a created signing key. You can use an exported key in other
applications or import it into another instance of the Avalanche-CLI.

By default, the tool writes the hex encoded key to stdout. If you provide the --output
flag, the command writes the key to a file of your choosing.
- [`list`](#list): The key list command prints information for all stored signing
keys or for the ledger addresses associated to certain indices.
- [`transfer`](#transfer): The key transfer command allows to transfer funds between stored keys or ledger addresses.

## avalanche network

The network command suite provides a collection of tools for managing local Subnet
deployments.

When you deploy a Subnet locally, it runs on a local, multi-node Avalanche network. The
subnet deploy command starts this network in the background. This command suite allows you
to shutdown, restart, and clear that network.

This network currently supports multiple, concurrently deployed Subnets.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche network [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
-h, --help help             for network
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

**Subcommands:**

- [`clean`](#clean): The network clean command shuts down your local, multi-node network. All deployed Subnets
shutdown and delete their state. You can restart the network by deploying a new Subnet
configuration.
- [`start`](#start): The network start command starts a local, multi-node Avalanche network on your machine.

By default, the command loads the default snapshot. If you provide the --snapshot-name
flag, the network loads that snapshot instead. The command fails if the local network is
already running.
- [`status`](#status): The network status command prints whether or not a local Avalanche
network is running and some basic stats about the network.
- [`stop`](#stop): The network stop command shuts down your local, multi-node network.

All deployed Subnets shutdown gracefully and save their state. If you provide the
--snapshot-name flag, the network saves its state under this named snapshot. You can
reload this snapshot with network start --snapshot-name `snapshotName`. Otherwise, the
network saves to the default snapshot, overwriting any existing state. You can reload the
default snapshot with network start.

### clean

The network clean command shuts down your local, multi-node network. All deployed Subnets
shutdown and delete their state. You can restart the network by deploying a new Subnet
configuration.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche network clean [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash

### start

The network start command starts a local, multi-node Avalanche network on your machine.

By default, the command loads the default snapshot. If you provide the --snapshot-name
flag, the network loads that snapshot instead. The command fails if the local network is
already running.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche network start [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
--avalanchego-path string       use this avalanchego binary path
--avalanchego-version string    use this version of avalanchego (ex: v1.17.12) (default "latest-prerelease")
-h, --help help                 for start
--num-nodes uint32              number of nodes to be created on local network (default 2)
--relayer-path string           use this relayer binary path
--relayer-version string        use this relayer version (default "latest-prerelease")
--snapshot-name string          name of snapshot to use to start the network from (default "default-1654102509")
--config string                 config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string              log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip        check for new versions
```

### status

The network status command prints whether or not a local Avalanche
network is running and some basic stats about the network.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche network status [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
-h, --help help             for status
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

### stop

The network stop command shuts down your local, multi-node network.

All deployed Subnets shutdown gracefully and save their state. If you provide the
--snapshot-name flag, the network saves its state under this named snapshot. You can
reload this snapshot with network start --snapshot-name `snapshotName`. Otherwise, the
network saves to the default snapshot, overwriting any existing state. You can reload the
default snapshot with network start.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche network stop [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
--dont-save do              not save snapshot, just stop the network
-h, --help help             for stop
--snapshot-name string      name of snapshot to use to save network state into (default "default-1654102509")
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

## avalanche node

The node command suite provides a collection of tools for creating and maintaining 
validators on Avalanche Network.

To get started, use the node create command wizard to walk through the
configuration to make your node a primary validator on Avalanche public network. You can use the 
rest of the commands to maintain your node and make your node a Subnet Validator.

**Usage:** 
```bash
avalanche node [subcommand] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

```bash
-h, --help help             for node
--config string             config file (default is $HOME/.avalanche-cli/config.json)
--log-level string          log level for the application (default "ERROR")
--skip-update-check skip    check for new versions
```

**Subcommands:**

- [`addDashboard`](#adddashboard): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode. 

The node addDashboard command adds custom dashboard to the Grafana monitoring dashboard for the 
cluster.
- [`create`](#create): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode. 

The node create command sets up a validator on a cloud server of your choice. 
The validator will be validating the Avalanche Primary Network and Subnet 
of your choice. By default, the command runs an interactive wizard. It 
walks you through all the steps you need to set up a validator.
Once this command is completed, you will have to wait for the validator
to finish bootstrapping on the primary network before running further
commands on it, e.g. validating a Subnet. You can check the bootstrapping
status by running avalanche node status 

The created node will be part of group of validators called `clusterName` 
and users can call node commands with `clusterName` so that the command
will apply to all nodes in the cluster
- [`destroy`](#destroy): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node destroy command terminates all running nodes in cloud server and deletes all storage disks.

If there is a static IP address attached, it will be released.
- [`devnet`](#devnet): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node devnet command suite provides a collection of commands related to devnets.
You can check the updated status by calling avalanche node status `clusterName`
- [`export`](#export): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node export command exports cluster configuration and its nodes config to a text file.

If no file is specified, the configuration is printed to the stdout.

Use --include-secrets to include keys in the export. In this case please keep the file secure as it contains sensitive information.

Exported cluster configuration without secrets can be imported by another user using node import command.
- [`import`](#import): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node import command imports cluster configuration and its nodes configuration from a text file
created from the node export command.

Prior to calling this command, call node whitelist command to have your SSH public key and IP whitelisted by
the cluster owner. This will enable you to use cli commands to manage the imported cluster.

Please note, that this imported cluster will be considered as EXTERNAL by cli, so some commands
affecting cloud nodes like node create or node destroy will be not applicable to it.
- [`list`](#list): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node list command lists all clusters together with their nodes.
- [`loadtest`](#loadtest): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode. 

The node loadtest command suite starts and stops a load test for an existing devnet cluster.
- [`local`](#local): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node local command suite provides a collection of commands related to local nodes
- [`refresh-ips`](#refresh-ips): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node refresh-ips command obtains the current IP for all nodes with dynamic IPs in the cluster,
and updates the local node information used by the Avalanche-CLI commands.
- [`resize`](#resize): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node resize command can change the amount of CPU, memory and disk space available for the cluster nodes.
- [`scp`](#scp): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node scp command securely copies files to and from nodes. Remote source or destionation can be specified using the following format:
[clusterName|nodeID|instanceID|IP]:/path/to/file. Regular expressions are supported for the source files like /tmp/*.txt.
File transfer to the nodes are parallelized. IF source or destination is cluster, the other should be a local file path. 
If both destinations are remote, they must be nodes for the same cluster and not clusters themselves.
For example:
$ avalanche node scp [cluster1|node1]:/tmp/file.txt /tmp/file.txt
$ avalanche node scp /tmp/file.txt [cluster1|NodeID-XXXX]:/tmp/file.txt
$ avalanche node scp node1:/tmp/file.txt NodeID-XXXX:/tmp/file.txt
- [`ssh`](#ssh): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node ssh command execute a given command [cmd] using ssh on all nodes in the cluster if ClusterName is given.
If no command is given, just prints the ssh command to be used to connect to each node in the cluster.
For provided NodeID or InstanceID or IP, the command [cmd] will be executed on that node.
If no [cmd] is provided for the node, it will open ssh shell there.
- [`status`](#status): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node status command gets the bootstrap status of all nodes in a cluster with the Primary Network. 
If no cluster is given, defaults to node list behaviour.

To get the bootstrap status of a node with a Blockchain, use --blockchain flag
- [`sync`](#sync): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node sync command enables all nodes in a cluster to be bootstrapped to a Blockchain.
You can check the blockchain bootstrap status by calling avalanche node status `clusterName` --blockchain `blockchainName`
- [`update`](#update): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node update command suite provides a collection of commands for nodes to update
their avalanchego or VM config.

You can check the status after update by calling avalanche node status
- [`upgrade`](#upgrade): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node update command suite provides a collection of commands for nodes to update
their avalanchego or VM version.

You can check the status after upgrade by calling avalanche node status
- [`validate`](#validate): (ALPHA Warning) This command is currently in experimental mode.

The node validate command suite provides a collection of commands for nodes to join
the Primary Network and Subnets as validators.
If any of the commands is run before the nodes are bootstrapped on the Primary Network, the command 
will fail. You can check the bootstrap status by calling avalanche node status `clusterName`
- [`whitelist`](#whitelist): (ALPHA Warning) The whitelist command suite provides a collection of tools for granting access to the cluster.

	Command adds IP if --ip params provided to cloud security access rules allowing it to access all nodes in the cluster via ssh or http.
	It also command adds SSH public key to all nodes in the cluster if --ssh params is there.
	If no params provided it detects current user IP automaticaly and whitelists it
