description: Script to install AvalancheGo on any Linux computer.
---

AvalancheGo Installer is a shell (bash) script that installs AvalancheGo on any Linux computer. This script sets up full, running node in a matter of minutes with minimal user input required. This is convenient if you want to run the node as a service on a standalone Linux installation, for example to set up a (Avalanche L1) validator, use the node as a private RPC server and similar uses. It also makes upgrading or reinstalling the nodes easy.

How-to: [Run an Avalanche Node Using the Install Script](/docs/nodes/using-install-script/installing-avalanche-go)

If you want to run a node in a more complex environment, like in a docker or Kubernetes container, or as a part of an installation orchestrated using a tool like Terraform, this installer probably won't fit your purposes. See here for how to run AvalancheGo in a [Docker container](/docs/tooling/guides/run-with-docker).
