title: Create Avalanche L1
description: This page demonstrates how to create an Avalanche L1 using Avalanche-CLI.
---

This tutorial walks you through the process of using Avalanche-CLI to create an Avalanche L1, deploy it to a local network, and connect to it with Core wallet.

The first step of learning Avalanche L1 development is learning to use [Avalanche-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli).

Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to install the latest Avalanche-CLI binary is by running the install script:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The binary installs inside the `~/bin` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

You can run all of the commands in this tutorial by calling `~/bin/avalanche`.

You can also add the command to your system path by running:

```bash
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

To make this change permanent, add this line to your shell’s initialization file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). For example:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Once you add it to your path, you should be able to call the program anywhere with just: `avalanche`

For more detailed installation instructions, see [Avalanche-CLI Installation](/docs/tooling/guides/get-avalanche-cli).

Create Your Avalanche L1 Configuration[​](#create-your-avalanche-l1-configuration "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial teaches you how to create an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based Avalanche L1. To do so, you use Subnet-EVM, Avalanche's L1 fork of the EVM. It supports airdrops, custom fee tokens, configurable gas parameters, and multiple stateful precompiles. To learn more, take a look at [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm). The goal of your first command is to create a Subnet-EVM configuration.

The `avalanche-cli` command suite provides a collection of tools for developing and deploying Avalanche L1s.

The Creation Wizard walks you through the process of creating your Avalanche L1. To get started, first pick a name for your Avalanche L1. This tutorial uses `myblockchain`, but feel free to substitute that with any name you like. Once you've picked your name, run:

```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain
```

The following sections walk through each question in the wizard.

### Choose Your VM

```bash
? Which Virtual Machine would you like to use?: 
  ▸ Subnet-EVM
    Custom VM
    Explain the difference
```
Select `Subnet-EVM`.

### Choose Validator Manager

```text
? Which validator management type would you like to use in your blockchain?: 
  ▸ Proof Of Authority
    Proof Of Stake
    Explain the difference
```
Select `Proof Of Authority`.

```text
? Which address do you want to enable as controller of ValidatorManager contract?: 
  ▸ Get address from an existing stored key (created from avalanche key create or avalanche key import)
    Custom
```
Select `Get address from an existing stored key`.

```text
? Which stored key should be used enable as controller of ValidatorManager contract?: 
  ▸ ewoq
    cli-awm-relayer
    cli-teleporter-deployer
```
Select `ewoq`.

This key is used to manage (add/remove) the validator set.

<Callout>
Do not use EWOQ key in a testnet or production setup. The EWOQ private key is publicly exposed.
</Callout>

To learn more about different validator management types, see [PoA vs PoS](/evm-l1s/validator-manager/poa-vs-pos).

### Choose Blockchain Configuration

```text
? Do you want to use default values for the Blockchain configuration?: 
  ▸ I want to use defaults for a test environment
    I want to use defaults for a production environment
    I don't want to use default values
    Explain the difference
```

Select `I want to use defaults for a test environment`.
This will automatically setup the configuration for a test environment, including an airdrop to the EWOQ key and Avalanche ICM.

### Enter Your Avalanche L1's ChainID

```text
✗ Chain ID: 
```

Choose a positive integer for your EVM-style ChainID.

In production environments, this ChainID needs to be unique and not shared with any other chain. You can visit [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to verify that your selection is unique. Because this is a development Avalanche L1, feel free to pick any number. Stay away from well-known ChainIDs such as 1 (Ethereum) or 43114 (Avalanche C-Chain) as those may cause issues with other tools.

### Token Symbol

```text
✗ Token Symbol: 
```

Enter a string to name your Avalanche L1's native token. The token symbol doesn't necessarily need to be unique. Example token symbols are AVAX, JOE, and BTC.

### Wrapping Up

If all worked successfully, the command prints:
```bash
✓ Successfully created blockchain configuration
```

You've successfully created your first Avalanche L1 configuration. Now it's time to deploy it.
