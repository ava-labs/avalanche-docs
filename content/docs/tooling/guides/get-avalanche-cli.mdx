Compatibility[​](#compatibility "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------

Avalanche-CLI runs on Linux and Mac. Windows is currently not supported.

Instructions[​](#instructions "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

To download a binary for the latest release, run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The script installs the binary inside the `~/bin` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

Adding Avalanche-CLI to Your PATH[​](#adding-avalanche-cli-to-your-path "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To call the `avalanche` binary from anywhere, you'll need to add it to your system path. If you installed the binary into the default location, you can run the following snippet to add it to your path.

To add it to your path permanently, add an export command to your shell initialization script. If you run `bash`, use `.bashrc`. If you run `zsh`, use `.zshrc`.

For example:

```bash
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH >> .bashrc
```

Checking Your Installation[​](#checking-your-installation "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can test your installation by running `avalanche --version`. The tool should print the running version.

Updating[​](#updating "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------

To update your installation, you need to delete your current binary and download the latest version using the preceding steps.

Building from Source[​](#building-from-source "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli).

After you've cloned the repository, checkout the tag you'd like to run. You can compile the code by running `./scripts/build.sh` from the top level directory.

The build script names the binary `./bin/avalanche`.
