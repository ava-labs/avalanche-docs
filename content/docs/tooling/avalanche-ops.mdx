It provisions all resources required to run a node or network with recommended setups (configurable).

This tool is intended for quickly creating, testing and iterating over various Avalanche network infrastructure configurations for testing and simulation purposes. Use this to play with various setups and reproduce potential problems and issues with possible configurations.
