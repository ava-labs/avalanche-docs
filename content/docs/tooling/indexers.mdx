### Blockflow

[Blockflow](https://www.blockflow.network/) simplifies building data backends for dApps.
The modular architecture seamlessly handles on-chain data retrieval, re-org handling, indexing, streaming, storage, and API consumption, allowing developers to focus on building innovative applications rather than wrestling with complex data infrastructure.

Blockflow's modular architecture for data indexing has three key components:

- **Instances:** Serverless functions that act as your data transformation and compute layer. These functions are triggered by blockchain events, function calls, transactions, and traces, allowing you to filter and process data exactly as you need it.
- **Managed Storage:** A scalable storage solution that houses your transformed blockchain data. Our storage layer ensures data integrity by handling chain reorganizations, providing you with a reliable, always-consistent dataset.
- **Flexible Querying:** Access your data effortlessly through our REST and GraphQL APIs. Define your own query logic to retrieve precisely the information you need, when you need it.

To get started visit our [documentation](https://docs.blockflow.network/v/cli). Also do checkout an example [here](https://docs.blockflow.network/v/cli/hands-on-project/ens).

### SubQuery

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project.

### Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) provides real-time and historical custom data indexing for any EVM-compatible chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.

### Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM.

Envio supports [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) on Avalanche. HyperSync is a real-time indexed layer of the Avalanche blockchain, providing accelerated APIs (JSON-RPC bypass) for the hyper-speed syncing of Avalanche data. Developers do not need to worry about RPC URLs, rate-limiting, or managing infrastructure, and can easily sync large datasets in a few minutes, something that would usually take 100x longer via standard RPC.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/getting-started) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/contract-import) guide.

### DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://dipdup.io/docs/supported-networks/avalanche) or follow the [quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart-evm) guide.
