### SubQuery

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project.

### Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) provides real-time and historical custom data indexing for any EVM-compatible chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.

### Envio 

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM.

Envio supports [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) on Avalanche. HyperSync is a real-time indexed layer of the Avalanche blockchain, providing accelerated APIs (JSON-RPC bypass) for the hyper-speed syncing of Avalanche data. Developers do not need to worry about RPC URLs, rate-limiting, or managing infrastructure, and can easily sync large datasets in a few minutes, something that would usually take 100x longer via standard RPC.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/getting-started) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/contract-import) guide.
