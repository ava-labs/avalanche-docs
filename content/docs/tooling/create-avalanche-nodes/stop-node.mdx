Terminating All Nodes[â€‹](#terminating-all-nodes "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To terminate all nodes in a cluster, run:

```bash
avalanche node destroy <clusterName>
```

<Callout type="warn">
ALPHA WARNING: This command will delete all files associated with the cloud servers in the cluster. This includes the downloaded `staker.crt` and `staker.key` files in your local `.avalanche-cli` directory (which are used to back up your node). More info about node backup can be found [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/node-backup-and-restore).
</Callout>

Once completed, the instance set up on AWS / GCP would have been terminated and the Static Public IP associated with it would have been released.
