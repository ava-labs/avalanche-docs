<Callout title="Note">
Currently, only Fuji network and Devnets are supported.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
ALPHA WARNING: This command is currently in experimental mode. Proceed at your own risk.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to have:

- Created a cloud server node as described [here](/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/run-validators-aws)
- Created a Custom VM, as described [here](/docs/virtual-machines).
- (Ignore for Devnet) Set up a key to be able to pay for transaction Fees, as described [here](/docs/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet).

Currently, only AWS & GCP cloud services are supported.

Deploying the VM[​](#deploying-the-vm "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------

We will be deploying the [MorpheusVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/tree/main/examples/morpheusvm) example built with the HyperSDK.

The following settings will be used:

- Repo url: `https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/`
- Branch Name: `vryx-poc`
- Build Script: `examples/morpheusvm/scripts/build.sh`

<Callout title="Note">
The CLI needs a public repo url in order to be able to download and install the custom VM on cloud.
</Callout>

### Genesis File[​](#genesis-file "Direct link to heading")

The following contents will serve as the chain genesis. They were generated using `morpheus-cli` as shown [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/blob/main/examples/morpheusvm/scripts/run.sh).

Save it into a file with path `<genesisPath>` (for example `~/morpheusvm_genesis.json`):

```bash

  "minBlockGap":1000,
  "minUnitPrice":[1,1,1,1,1],
  "maxChunkUnits":[1800000,18446744073709551615,18446744073709551615,18446744073709551615,18446744073709551615],

    }
  ]
}
```

Create the Avalanche L1[​](#create-the-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's create an Avalanche L1 called `<blockchainName>`, with custom VM binary and genesis.

```bash
avalanche blockchain create <blockchainName>
```

Choose custom

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose your VM:
    Subnet-EVM
  ▸ Custom
```

Provide path to genesis:

```bash
✗ Enter path to custom genesis: <genesisPath>
```

Provide the source code repo url:

```bash
✗ Source code repository URL: https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/
```

Set the branch and finally set the build script:

```bash
✗ Build script: examples/morpheusvm/scripts/build.sh
```

CLI will generate a locally compiled binary, and then create the Avalanche L1.

```bash
Cloning into ...

Successfully created subnet configuration
```

## Deploy Avalanche L1

For this example, we will deploy the Avalanche L1 and blockchain on Fuji. Run:

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy <blockchainName>
```

Choose Fuji:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to deploy on:
    Local Network
  ▸ Fuji
    Mainnet
```

Use the stored key:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Which key source should be used to pay transaction fees?:
  ▸ Use stored key
    Use ledger
```

Choose `<keyName>` as the key to use to pay the fees:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Which stored key should be used to pay transaction fees?:
  ▸ <keyName>
```

Use the same key as the control key for the Avalanche L1:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? How would you like to set your control keys?:
  ▸ Use fee-paying key
    Use all stored keys
    Custom list
```

The successfully creation of our Avalanche L1 and blockchain is confirmed by the following output:

```bash
Your Subnet's control keys: [P-fuji1dlwux652lkflgz79g3nsphjzvl6t35xhmunfk1]
Your subnet auth keys for chain creation: [P-fuji1dlwux652lkflgz79g3nsphjzvl6t35xhmunfk1]
Subnet has been created with ID: RU72cWmBmcXber6ZBPT7R5scFFuVSoFRudcS3vayf3L535ZE3

Set the Config Files[​](#set-the-config-files "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avalanche-CLI supports uploading the full set of configuration files for a blockchain:

- Genesis File
- Blockchain Config
- Avalanche L1 Config
- Network Upgrades
- AvalancheGo Config

The following example uses all of them, but the user can decide to provide a subset of those.

### AvalancheGo Flags[​](#avalanchego-flags "Direct link to heading")

Save the following content (as defined [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/blob/vryx-poc/examples/morpheusvm/tests/e2e/e2e_test.go))
into a file with path `<avagoFlagsPath>` (for example `~/morpheusvm_avago.json`):

```json

```

```bash
Node(s) successfully started syncing with Subnet!
```

Your custom VM is successfully deployed!

You can also use `avalanche node update blockchain <blockchainName>` to reinstall the binary when the branch is updated, or update the config files.
