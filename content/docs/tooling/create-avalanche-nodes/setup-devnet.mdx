title: Setup a Devnet
description: This page demonstrates how to setup a Devnet of cloud-based validators using Avalanche-CLI, and deploy a VM into it.
---

Devnets (Developer Networks) are isolated Avalanche networks deployed on the cloud. Similar to local networks in terms of configuration and usage but installed on remote nodes.

Think of DevNets as being an intermediate step in the developer testing process after local network and before Fuji network.

<Callout type="warn">
ALPHA WARNING: This command is currently in experimental mode. Proceed at your own risk.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to create an AWS account and have an updated AWS `credentials` file in home directory with [default] profile or set up your GCP account according to [here](/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/run-validators-gcp).

Note: the tutorial uses AWS hosts, but Devnets can also be created and operated in other supported cloud providers, such as GCP.

## Setting up a Devnet

Setting up a Devnet consists of:

- Creating a cluster of cloud servers
- Deploying an Avalanche L1 into the cluster
- Adding the cloud servers as validator nodes in the Avalanche L1

To execute all steps above in one command, run:

```bash
avalanche node devnet wiz <clusterName>
```

Command line flags can be used instead of interacting with the prompts. The complete command line
flags for `devnet wiz` command can be found [here](/tooling/avalanche-cli#node-devnet-wiz).

Let's go through several examples with the full command (with flags) provided.

### Create a Devnet and Deploy Subnet-EVM Based Avalanche L1 into the Devnet

For example, to spin up a Devnet with 5 validator nodes and 1 API node in 5 regions each 
(us-west-2,us-east-1,ap-south-1,ap-northeast-1,eu-west-1) in AWS with each node having spec of 
c7g.8xlarge AWS EC2 instance type and io2 volume type, with Avalanche L1 `<blockchainName>` deployed 
into the Devnet, we will run :

```bash
avalanche node devnet wiz <clusterName> <blockchainName> --authorize-access
  --aws --num-apis 1,1,1,1,1 --num-validators 5,5,5,5,5 
  --region us-west-2,us-east-1,ap-south-1,ap-northeast-1,eu-west-1 --default-validator-params 
  --node-type c7g.8xlarge --aws-volume-type=io2

Creating the devnet
...
Waiting for node(s) in cluster <clusterName> to be healthy...
...
Nodes healthy after 33 seconds

Deploying the subnet
...
Setting the nodes as subnet trackers
...
Waiting for node(s) in cluster <clusterName>to be healthy...
Nodes healthy after 33 seconds
...
Waiting for node(s) in cluster <clusterName> to be syncing subnet <blockchainName>...
Nodes Syncing <blockchainName> after 5 seconds

Adding nodes as subnet validators
...
Waiting for node(s) in cluster <clusterName> to be validating subnet <blockchainName>...
Nodes Validating <blockchainName> after 23 seconds

Devnet <clusterName> has been created and is validating subnet <blockchainName>!
```

### Create a Devnet and Deploy a Custom VM based Avalanche L1 into the Devnet

For this example, we will be using the custom VM [MorpheusVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/tree/main/examples/morpheusvm)
built with [HyperSDK](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk).

The following settings will be used:

- `<repoUrl>` `https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/`
- `<branch>` `vryx-poc`
- `<buildScript>` `examples/morpheusvm/scripts/build.sh`
- `<genesisPath>` [Genesis File](/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/deploy-custom-vm#genesis-file)
- `<chainConfigPath>` [Blockchain Config](/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/deploy-custom-vm#blockchain-config)
- `<subnetConfigPath>` [Avalanche L1 Config](/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/deploy-custom-vm#avalanche-l1-config)
- `<avagoConfigPath>` [AvalancheGo Config](/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/deploy-custom-vm#avalanchego-flags)

To spin up a Devnet with 5 validator nodes and 1 API node in 5 regions each
(us-west-2,us-east-1,ap-south-1,ap-northeast-1,eu-west-1) in AWS with each node having spec of
c7g.8xlarge AWS EC2 instance type and io2 volume type, with the Custom VM based Avalanche L1 
`<blockchainName>` deployed into the Devnet, we will run :

```bash
avalanche node devnet wiz <clusterName> <blockchainName> --custom-subnet \
  --subnet-genesis <genesisPath> --custom-vm-repo-url <repoUrl> \
  --custom-vm-branch <branch> --custom-vm-build-script <buildScript> \
  --chain-config <chainConfigPath> --subnet-config <subnetConfigPath> \
  --node-config <avagoConfigPath> --authorize-access --aws --num-apis 1,1,1,1,1 \
  --num-validators 5,5,5,5,5  --region us-west-2,us-east-1,ap-south-1,ap-northeast-1,eu-west-1 \
  --default-validator-params --node-type default
