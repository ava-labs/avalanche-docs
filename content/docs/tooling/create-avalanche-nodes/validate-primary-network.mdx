title: Validate the Primary Network
description: This page demonstrates how to configure nodes to validate the Primary Network. Validation vian Avalanche-CLI is currently only supported on Fuji.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to have:

- Created a Cloud Server node as described for [AWS](/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/run-validators-aws) or [GCP](/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/run-validators-gcp)
- A node bootstrapped to the Primary Network (run `avalanche node status <clusterName>`to check bootstrap status as described[here](/docs/tooling/create-avalanche-nodes/run-validators-aws#check-bootstrap-status)
- Stored key / Ledger with AVAX to pay for gas fess associated with adding node as Primary Network. Instructions on how to fund stored key on Fuji can be found [here](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet#funding-the-key).

Be a Primary Network Validator[​](#be-a-primary-network-validator "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once all nodes in a cluster are bootstrapped to Primary Network, we can now have the nodes be Primary Network Validators.

To have all nodes in cluster `clusterName` be Primary Network Validators, run:

```bash
avalanche node validate primary <clusterName>
```

The nodes will start validating the Primary Network 20 seconds after the command is run.

The wizard will ask us how we want to pay for the transaction fee. Choose `Use stored key` for Fuji:

```bash
 Which key source should be used to pay transaction fees?:
  ▸ Use stored key
    Use ledger
```

Once you have selected the key to pay with, choose how many AVAX you would like to stake in the validator. Default is the minimum amount of AVAX that can be staked in a Fuji Network Validator. More info regarding minimum staking amount in different networks can be found [here](/nodes/validate/how-to-stake#fuji-testnet).

```bash
 What stake weight would you like to assign to the validator?:
  ▸ Default (1.00 AVAX)
    Custom
```

Next, choose how long the node will be validating for:

```bash
 How long should your validator validate for?:
  ▸ Minimum staking duration on primary network
    Custom
```

Once all the inputs are completed you will see transaction IDs indicating that all the nodes in the cluster will be Primary Network Validators once the start time has elapsed.
