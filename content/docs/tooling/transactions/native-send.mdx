title: Send AVAX on C/P-Chain
description: Learn how to execute a native transfer on the C or P-Chain using the Avalanche CLI.
---

# Prerequisites

- Install the [Avalanche CLI](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/guides/get-avalanche-cli).
- Use the CLI to [create a key](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanche-cli#key-create).
- Fund the key with AVAX. You can use the [faucet](https://test.core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `devrel-avax-0112` to get testnet AVAX. 
- *Optionally*, you can [export](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanche-cli#key-export) your private key for use in scripting or other tools. 

# Initiate the `transfer` Command and Walk Through the Prompts

In your terminal, run the following command:

```zsh
avalanche key transfer
```

<Callout title="Note">

This command and all of its flags are documented [here](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanche-cli#key-transfer).

</Callout>

You will be prompted to answer the following questions:

```zsh
? On what Network do you want to execute the transfer?:
  ▸ Mainnet
    Fuji Testnet
    Devnet
    Local Network
```
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Note: Devnet">
If you select "Devnet", you must input the RPC URL. If your devnet's C-Chain RPC is `https://demo.avax-dev.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`, you should input the URL as: 

```zsh
✔ Devnet Endpoint: https://demo.avax-dev.network
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Select the chain you want to transfer funds from:

```zsh
? Where are the funds to transfer?:
  ▸ P-Chain
    C-Chain
    My blockchain isn't listed
```

Select the chain you want to transfer funds to:

```zsh
? Destination Chain:
  ▸ P-Chain
    X-Chain
```

Select the step of the transfer process you want to execute:

```zsh
? Step of the transfer:
  ▸ Send
    Receive
```

<Callout title="Note">

If you are performing a native transfer where the sender and receiver address are on the same chain, you only need to complete a "send" transaction. 

If you wish to perform a cross-chain transfer (i.e. from C to P-Chain), you should abort this flow and reinitiate the command as `avalanche key transfer --fund-p-chain` or `avalanche key transfer --fund-x-chain`, completing both the "send" and "receive" flows with keys stored in the CLI.
You can fund your CLI-stored key with AVAX on the C-Chain using the [faucet](https://test.core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `devrel-avax-0112`.

Select the sender address:

```zsh
? Which key should be used as the sender?:
  ▸ Use stored key
    Use ledger
? Which stored key should be used as the sender address?:
  ▸ DemoKey
    MyKey
    ewoq
```

Specify the amount to send, input the destination address: 
  
```zsh
✗ Amount to send (AVAX units): 100
✗ Destination address: P-avax1zgjx8zj7z7zj7z7zj7z7zj7z7zj7zj7zj7zj7e
```

Review the transaction details and confirm/abort:

```zsh
this operation is going to:
- send 100.000000000 AVAX from P-avax1gmuqt8xg9j4h88kj3hyprt23nf50azlfg8txn2 to destination address P-avax1f630gvct4ht35ragcheapnn2n5cv2tkmq73ec0
- take a fee of 0.001000000 AVAX from source address P-avax1gmuqt8xg9j4h88kj3hyprt23nf50azlfg8txn2
? Confirm transfer:
    No
  ▸ Yes
```
