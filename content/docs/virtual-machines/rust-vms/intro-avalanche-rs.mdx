title: Introduction to Avalanche-RS
description: Learn how to write a simple virtual machine in Rust using Avalanche-RS.

Since Rust is a language which we can write and implement Proto interfaces, this implies that we can also use Rust to write VMs which can then be deployed on Avalanche.

However, rather than build Rust-based from the ground-up, we can utilize Avalanche-RS, a developer toolkit comprised of powerful building blocks and primitive types which allow us to focus exclusively on the business logic of our VM rather than working on low-level logic.

## Structure of Avalanche-RS

Although Avalanche-RS is currently primarily used to build Rust-based VMs, Avalanche-RS actually consists of three different frameworks; as per the [GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-rs) description of the Avalanche-RS repository, the three frameworks are as follows:

- Core: framework for core networking components for a P2P Avalanche node
- Avalanche-Consensus: a Rust implementation of the novel Avalanche consensus protocol
- Avalanche-Types: implements foundational types used in Avalanche and provides an SDK for building Rust-based VMs

As the above might make it obvious, the Avalanche-Types crate is the main framework that one would use to build Rust-based VMs.
