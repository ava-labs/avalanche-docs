title: Deploy a Smart Contract
description: Deploy a smart contract on your Subnet.
---

This tutorial assumes that:

- [A Subnet and EVM blockchain](/docs/subnets/deploy-a-subnet/fuji-testnet) has been created
- Your Node is currently validating your target Subnet
- Your wallet has a balance of the Subnet Native Token(Specified under _alloc_ in your [Genesis File](/docs/subnets/upgrade/customize-subnet#genesis)).

Step 1: Setting up Core[​](#step-1-setting-up-core "Direct link to heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **EVM Subnet Settings**: [(EVM Core Tutorial)](/docs/subnets/deploy-a-subnet/fuji-testnet#connect-with-core)[​](#evm-subnet-settings-evm-core-tutorial "Direct link to heading")

- **`Network Name`**: Custom Subnet-EVM
- **`New RPC URL`**: http://NodeIPAddress:9650/ext/bc/BlockchainID/rpc (Note: the port number should match your local setting which can be different from 9650.)
- **`ChainID`**: Subnet-EVM ChainID
- **`Symbol`**: Subnet-EVM Token Symbol
- **`Explorer`**: N/A

You should see a balance of your Subnet's Native Token in Core.

Step 2: Connect Core and Deploy a Smart Contract[​](#step-2-connect-core-and-deploy-a-smart-contract "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using Remix[​](#using-remix "Direct link to heading")

Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) -> Select Solidity.

![remix Subnet evm sc home](/images/smart-contract2.png)

Create the smart contracts that we want to compile and deploy using Remix file explorer

### Using GitHub[​](#using-github "Direct link to heading")

In Remix Home _Click_ the GitHub button.

![remix Subnet evm sc load panel](/images/smart-contract3.png)

Paste the [link to the Smart Contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/NFT.sol) into the popup and _Click_ import.

![remix Subnet evm sc import](/images/smart-contract4.png)

For this example, we will deploy an ERC721 contract from the [Avalanche Smart Contract Quickstart Repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart).

![remix Subnet evm sc file explorer](/images/smart-contract5.png)

Navigate to Deploy Tab -> Open the "ENVIRONMENT" drop-down and select Injected Web3 (make sure Core is loaded).

![remix Subnet evm sc web3](/images/smart-contract6.png)

Once we injected the web3-> Go back to the compiler, and compile the selected contract -> Navigate to Deploy Tab.

![remix Subnet evm sc compile](/images/smart-contract7.png)

Now, the smart contract is compiled, Core is injected, and we are ready to deploy our ERC721. Click "Deploy."

![remix Subnet evm sc deploy](/images/smart-contract8.png)

Confirm the transaction on the Core pop up.

![balance](/images/smart-contract9.png)

Our contract is successfully deployed!

![remix Subnet evm sc deployed](/images/smart-contract10.png)

Now, we can expand it by selecting it from the "Deployed Contracts" tab and test it out.

![remix Subnet evm sc end](/images/smart-contract11.png)

The contract ABI and Bytecode are available on the compiler tab.

You can use Subnet-EVM just like you use C-Chain and EVM tools. Only differences are `chainID` and RPC URL. For example you can deploy your contracts with [hardhat quick start guide](/docs/dapps/toolchains/hardhat) by changing `url` and `chainId` in the `hardhat.config.ts`.
