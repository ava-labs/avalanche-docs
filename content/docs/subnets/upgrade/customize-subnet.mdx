title: Customize a Subnet
description: Learn how to customize your EVM-powered Subnet.
---

All Subnets can be customized by utilizing [`Subnet Configs`](#subnet-configs).

A Subnet can have one or more blockchains. For example, the Primary Network, which is a Subnet, a special one nonetheless, has 3 blockchains. Each chain can be further customized using chain specific configuration file. See [here](/docs/nodes/configure/configs-flags) for detailed explanation.

A blockchain created by or forked from [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) can be customized by utilizing one or more of the following methods:

- [Genesis](#genesis)
- [Precompile](#precompiles)
- [Upgrade Configs](#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles)
- [Chain Configs](#avalanchego-chain-configs)

Subnet Configs[​](#subnet-configs "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------

A Subnet can customized by setting parameters for the following:

- [Validator-only communication to create a private Subnet](/docs/nodes/configure/subnet-configs#validatoronly-bool)
- [Consensus](/docs/nodes/configure/subnet-configs#consensus-parameters)
- [Gossip](/docs/nodes/configure/subnet-configs#gossip-configs)

See [here](/docs/nodes/configure/subnet-configs) for more info.

Genesis[​](#genesis "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------

Each blockchain has some genesis state when it's created. Each Virtual Machine defines the format and semantics of its genesis data.

The default genesis Subnet-EVM provided below has some well defined parameters:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 43214,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip150Hash": "0x2086799aeebeae135c246c65021c82b4e15a2c451340993aacfd2751886514f0",
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "muirGlacierBlock": 0,
    "feeConfig": {
      "gasLimit": 15000000,
      "minBaseFee": 25000000000,
      "targetGas": 15000000,
      "baseFeeChangeDenominator": 36,
      "minBlockGasCost": 0,
      "maxBlockGasCost": 1000000,
      "targetBlockRate": 2,
      "blockGasCostStep": 200000
    },
    "allowFeeRecipients": false
  },
  "alloc": {
    "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
      "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
    }
  },
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "timestamp": "0x0",
  "extraData": "0x00",
  "gasLimit": "0xe4e1c0",
  "difficulty": "0x0",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "number": "0x0",
  "gasUsed": "0x0",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

### Chain Config[​](#chain-config "Direct link to heading")

`chainID`: Denotes the ChainID of to be created chain. Must be picked carefully since a conflict with other chains can cause issues. One suggestion is to check with [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) to avoid ID collision, reserve and publish your ChainID properly.

You can use `eth_getChainConfig` RPC call to get the current chain config. See [here](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_getchainconfig) for more info.

#### Hard Forks[​](#hard-forks "Direct link to heading")

`homesteadBlock`, `eip150Block`, `eip150Hash`, `eip155Block`, `byzantiumBlock`, `constantinopleBlock`, `petersburgBlock`, `istanbulBlock`, `muirGlacierBlock` are EVM hard fork activation times. Changing these may cause issues, so treat them carefully.

#### Fee Config[​](#fee-config "Direct link to heading")

`gasLimit`: Sets the max amount of gas consumed per block. This restriction puts a cap on the amount of computation that can be done in a single block, which in turn sets a limit on the maximum gas usage allowed for a single transaction. For reference, C-Chain value is set to `15,000,000`.

`targetBlockRate`: Sets the target rate of block production in seconds. A target of 2 will target producing a block every 2 seconds. If the network starts producing blocks at a faster rate, it indicates that more blocks than anticipated are being issued to the network, resulting in an increase in base fees. For C-chain this value is set to `2`.

`minBaseFee`: Sets a lower bound on the EIP-1559 base fee of a block. Since the block's base fee sets the minimum gas price for any transaction included in that block, this effectively sets a minimum gas price for any transaction.

`targetGas`: Specifies the targeted amount of gas (including block gas cost) to consume within a rolling 10-seconds window. When the dynamic fee algorithm observes that network activity is above/below the `targetGas`, it increases/decreases the base fee proportionally to how far above/below the target actual network activity is. If the network starts producing blocks with gas cost higher than this, base fees are increased accordingly.

`baseFeeChangeDenominator`: Divides the difference between actual and target utilization to determine how much to increase/decrease the base fee. A larger denominator indicates a slower changing, stickier base fee, while a lower denominator allows the base fee to adjust more quickly. For reference, the C-chain value is set to `36`. This value sets the base fee to increase or decrease by a factor of `1/36` of the parent block's base fee.

`minBlockGasCost`: Sets the minimum amount of gas to charge for the production of a block. This value is set to `0` in C-Chain.

`maxBlockGasCost`: Sets the maximum amount of gas to charge for the production of a block.

`blockGasCostStep`: Determines how much to increase/decrease the block gas cost depending on the amount of time elapsed since the previous block.

If the block is produced at the target rate, the block gas cost will stay the same as the block gas cost for the parent block.

If it is produced faster/slower, the block gas cost will be increased/decreased by the step value for each second faster/slower than the target block rate accordingly.

<Callout title="Note">
If the `blockGasCostStep` is set to a very large number, it effectively requires block production to go no faster than the `targetBlockRate`. For example, if a block is produced two seconds faster than the target block rate, the block gas cost will increase by `2 * blockGasCostStep`.
</Callout>

#### Custom Fee Recipients[​](#custom-fee-recipients "Direct link to heading")

See section [Setting a Custom Fee Recipient](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient)

### Alloc[​](#alloc "Direct link to heading")

The fields `nonce`, `timestamp`, `extraData`, `gasLimit`, `difficulty`, `mixHash`, `coinbase`, `number`, `gasUsed`, `parentHash` defines the genesis block header. The field `gasLimit` should be set to match the `gasLimit` set in the `feeConfig`. You do not need to change any of the other genesis header fields.

`nonce`, `mixHash` and `difficulty` are remnant parameters from Proof of Work systems. For Avalanche, these don't play any relevant role, so you should just leave them as their default values:

`nonce`: The result of the mining process iteration is this value. It can be any value in the genesis block. Default value is `0x0`.

`mixHash`: The combination of `nonce` and `mixHash` allows to verify that the Block has really been cryptographically mined, thus, from this aspect, is valid. Default value is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

`difficulty`: The difficulty level applied during the nonce discovering process of this block. Default value is `0x0`.

`timestamp`: The timestamp of the creation of the genesis block. This is commonly set to `0x0`.

`extraData`: Optional extra data that can be included in the genesis block. This is commonly set to `0x`.

`gasLimit`: The total amount of gas that can be used in a single block. It should be set to the same value as in the [fee config](#fee-config). The value `e4e1c0` is hexadecimal and is equal to `15,000,000`.

`coinbase`: Refers to the address of the block producers. This also means it represents the recipient of the block reward. It is usually set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` for the genesis block. To allow fee recipients in Subnet-EVM, refer to [this section.](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient)

`parentHash`: This is the Keccak 256-bit hash of the entire parent block's header. It is usually set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` for the genesis block.

`gasUsed`: This is the amount of gas used by the genesis block. It is usually set to `0x0`.

`number`: This is the number of the genesis block. This required to be `0x0` for the genesis. Otherwise it will error.

### Genesis Examples[​](#genesis-examples "Direct link to heading")

Another example of a genesis file can be found in the [networks folder](https://github.com/ava-labs/public-chain-assets/blob/1951594346dcc91682bdd8929bcf8c1bf6a04c33/chains/11111/genesis.json). Please remove `airdropHash` and `airdropAmount` fields if you want to start with it.

Here are a few examples on how a genesis file is used: [scripts/run.sh](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/master/scripts/run.sh#L99)

### Setting the Genesis Allocation[​](#setting-the-genesis-allocation "Direct link to heading")

Alloc defines addresses and their initial balances. This should be changed accordingly for each chain. If you don't provide any genesis allocation, you won't be able to interact with your new chain (all transactions require a fee to be paid from the sender's balance).

The `alloc` field expects key-value pairs. Keys of each entry must be a valid `address`. The `balance` field in the value can be either a `hexadecimal` or `number` to indicate initial balance of the address. The default value contains `8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` with `50000000000000000000000000` balance in it. Default:

```json
"alloc": {
  "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
    "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
  }
}
```

To specify a different genesis allocation, populate the `alloc` field in the genesis JSON as follows:

```json
"alloc": {
  "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
    "balance": "0x52B7D2DCC80CD2E4000000"
  },
  "Ab5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B": {
    "balance": "0xa796504b1cb5a7c0000"
  }
},
```

The keys in the allocation are [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) addresses **without the canonical `0x` prefix**. The balances are denominated in Wei ([10^18 Wei = 1 Whole Unit of Native Token](https://eth-converter.com/)) and expressed as hex strings **with the canonical `0x` prefix**. You can use [this converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html) to translate between decimal and hex numbers.

The above example yields the following genesis allocations (denominated in whole units of the native token, that is 1 AVAX/1 WAGMI):

```bash
0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC: 100000000 (0x52B7D2DCC80CD2E4000000=100000000000000000000000000 Wei)
0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B: 49463 (0xa796504b1cb5a7c0000=49463000000000000000000 Wei)
```

### Setting a Custom Fee Recipient[​](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient "Direct link to heading")

By default, all fees are burned (sent to the black hole address with `"allowFeeRecipients": false`). However, it is possible to enable block producers to set a fee recipient (who will get compensated for blocks they produce).

To enable this feature, you'll need to add the following to your genesis file (under the `"config"` key):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "allowFeeRecipients": true
  }
}
```

#### Fee Recipient Address[​](#fee-recipient-address "Direct link to heading")

With `allowFeeRecipients` enabled, your validators can specify their addresses to collect fees. They need to update their EVM [chain config](#avalanchego-chain-configs) with the following to specify where the fee should be sent to.

```json
{
  "feeRecipient": "<YOUR 0x-ADDRESS>"
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
If `allowFeeRecipients` feature is enabled on the Subnet, but a validator doesn't specify a "feeRecipient", the fees will be burned in blocks it produces.
</Callout>

This mechanism can be also activated as a precompile. See [Changing Fee Reward Mechanisms](#changing-fee-reward-mechanisms) section for more details.

Precompiles[​](#precompiles "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------

Subnet-EVM can provide custom functionalities with precompiled contracts. These precompiled contracts can be activated through `ChainConfig` (in genesis or as an upgrade).

### AllowList Interface[​](#allowlist-interface "Direct link to heading")

The `AllowList` interface is used by precompiles to check if a given address is allowed to use a precompiled contract. `AllowList` consist of three roles, `Admin`, `Manager` and `Enabled`. `Admin` can add/remove other `Admin` and `Enabled` addresses. `Manager` is introduced with Durango upgrade and can add/remove `Enabled` addresses, without the ability to add/remove `Admin` or `Manager` addresses. `Enabled` addresses can use the precompiled contract, but cannot modify other roles.

`AllowList` adds `adminAddresses`, `managerAddresses`, `enabledAddresses` fields to precompile contract configurations. For instance fee manager precompile contract configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "feeManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "adminAddresses": [<list of addresses>],
    "managerAddresses": [<list of addresses>],
    "enabledAddresses": [<list of addresses>],
  }
}
```

`AllowList` configuration affects only the related precompile. For instance, the admin address in `feeManagerConfig` does not affect admin addresses in other activated precompiles.

The `AllowList` solidity interface is defined as follows, and can be found in [IAllowList.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/helloworld-official-tutorial-v2/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IAllowList.sol):

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IAllowList {
  event RoleSet(
    uint256 indexed role,
    address indexed account,
    address indexed sender,
    uint256 oldRole
  );

  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

`readAllowList(addr)` will return a uint256 with a value of 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to the roles `None`, `Enabled`, and `Admin` respectively.

`RoleSet` is an event that is emitted when a role is set for an address. It includes the role, the modified address, the sender as indexed parameters and the old role as non-indexed parameter. Events in precompiles are activated after Durango upgrade.

Note: `AllowList` is not an actual contract but just an interface. It's not callable by itself. This is used by other precompiles. Check other precompile sections to see how this works.

### Restricting Smart Contract Deployers[​](#restricting-smart-contract-deployers "Direct link to heading")

If you'd like to restrict who has the ability to deploy contracts on your Subnet, you can provide an `AllowList` configuration in your genesis or upgrade file:

```json
{
  "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
  }
}
```

In this example, `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` is named as the `Admin` of the `ContractDeployerAllowList`. This enables it to add other `Admin` or to add `Enabled` addresses. Both `Admin` and `Enabled` can deploy contracts. To provide a great UX with factory contracts, the `tx.Origin` is checked for being a valid deployer instead of the caller of `CREATE`. This means that factory contracts will still be able to create new contracts as long as the sender of the original transaction is an allow listed deployer.

The `Stateful Precompile` contract powering the `ContractDeployerAllowList` adheres to the [AllowList Solidity interface](#allowlist-interface) at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000` (you can load this interface and interact directly in Remix):

- If you attempt to add a `Enabled` and you are not an `Admin`, you will see something like: ![admin fail](/images/customize1.png)   
- If you attempt to deploy a contract but you are not an `Admin` not a `Enabled`, you will see something like: ![deploy fail](/images/customize2.png)
- If you call `readAllowList(addr)` then you can read the current role of `addr`, which will return a uint256 with a value of 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to the roles `None`, `Enabled`, and `Admin` respectively.

<Callout type="warn">
If you remove all of the admins from the allow list, it will no longer be possible to update the allow list without modifying the Subnet-EVM to schedule a network upgrade.
</Callout>

#### Initial Contract Allow List Configuration[​](#initial-contract-allow-list-configuration "Direct link to heading")

It's possible to enable this precompile with an initial configuration to activate its effect on activation timestamp. This provides a way to enable the precompile without an admin address to manage the deployer list. With this, you can define a list of addresses that are allowed to deploy contracts. Since there will be no admin address to manage the deployer list, it can only be modified through a network upgrade.

To use initial configuration, you need to specify addresses in `enabledAddresses` field in your genesis or upgrade file:

```json
{
  "contractDeployerAllowListConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "enabledAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
  }
}
```

This will allow only `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` to deploy contracts. For further information about precompile initial configurations see [Initial Precompile Configurations](#initial-precompile-configurations).

### Restricting Who Can Submit Transactions[​](#restricting-who-can-submit-transactions "Direct link to heading")

Similar to restricting contract deployers, this precompile restricts which addresses may submit transactions on chain. Like the previous section, you can activate the precompile by including an `AllowList` configuration in your genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` is named as the `Admin` of the `TransactionAllowList`. This enables them to add other `Admins` or to add `Allowed`. `Admins`, `Manager` and `Enabled` can submit transactions to the chain.

The `Stateful Precompile` contract powering the `TxAllowList` adheres to the [AllowList Solidity interface](#allowlist-interface) at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` (you can load this interface and interact directly in Remix):

- If you attempt to add an `Enabled` and you are not an `Admin`, you will see something like: ![admin fail](/images/customize3.png)   
- If you attempt to submit a transaction but you are not an `Admin`, `Manager` or not `Enabled`, you will see something like: `cannot issue transaction from non-allow listed address` 
- If you call `readAllowList(addr)` then you can read the current role of `addr`, which will return a `uint256` with a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3 corresponding to the roles `None`, `Allowed`, `Admin` and `Manager` respectively.

<Callout type="warn">
If you remove all of the admins and managers from the allow list, it will no longer be possible to update the allow list without modifying the Subnet-EVM to schedule a network upgrade.
</Callout>

#### Initial TX Allow List Configuration[​](#initial-tx-allow-list-configuration "Direct link to heading")

It's possible to enable this precompile with an initial configuration to activate its effect on activation timestamp. This provides a way to enable the precompile without an admin address to manage the TX allow list. With this, you can define a list of addresses that are allowed to submit transactions.

Since there will be no admin address to manage the TX list, it can only be modified through a network upgrade. To use initial configuration, you need to specify addresses in `enabledAddresses` field in your genesis or upgrade file:

```json
{
  "txAllowListConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "enabledAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
  }
}
```

This will allow only `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` to submit transactions. For further information about precompile initial configurations see [Initial Precompile Configurations](#initial-precompile-configurations).

### Minting Native Coins[​](#minting-native-coins "Direct link to heading")

You can mint native(gas) coins with a precompiled contract. In order to activate this feature, you can provide `nativeMinterConfig` in genesis:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

`adminAddresses` denotes admin accounts who can add other `Admin`, `Manager` or `Enabled` accounts. `Admin`, `Manager` and `Enabled` are both eligible to mint native coins for other addresses. `ContractNativeMinter` uses same methods as in `ContractDeployerAllowList`.

The `Stateful Precompile` contract powering the `ContractNativeMinter` adheres to the following Solidity interface at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001` (you can load this interface and interact directly in Remix):

```solidity
// (c) 2022-2023, Ava Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.
// See the file LICENSE for licensing terms.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "./IAllowList.sol";

interface INativeMinter is IAllowList {
  event NativeCoinMinted(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount
  );

  // Mint [amount] number of native coins and send to [addr]
  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

`mintNativeCoin` takes an address and amount of native coins to be minted. The amount denotes the amount in minimum denomination of native coins (10^18). For example, if you want to mint 1 native coin (in AVAX), you need to pass 1 \* 10^18 as the amount. A `NativeCoinMinted` event is emitted with the sender, recipient and amount when a native coin is minted.

Note that this uses `IAllowList` interface directly, meaning that it uses the same `AllowList` interface functions like `readAllowList` and `setAdmin`, `setManager`, `setEnabled`, `setNone`. For more information see [AllowList Solidity interface](#allowlist-interface).

<Callout type="warn">
EVM does not prevent overflows when storing the address balance. Overflows in balance opcodes are handled by setting the balance to maximum. However the same won't apply for API calls. If you try to mint more than the maximum balance, API calls will return the overflowed hex-balance. This can break external tooling. Make sure the total supply of native coins is always less than 2^256-1.
</Callout>

#### Initial Native Minter Configuration[​](#initial-native-minter-configuration "Direct link to heading")

It's possible to enable this precompile with an initial configuration to activate its effect on activation timestamp. This provides a way to enable the precompile without an admin address to mint native coins. With this, you can define a list of addresses that will receive an initial mint of the native coin when this precompile activates. This can be useful for networks that require a one-time mint without specifying any admin addresses. To use initial configuration, you need to specify a map of addresses with their corresponding mint amounts in `initialMint` field in your genesis or upgrade file:

```json
{
  "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "initialMint": {
      "0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": "1000000000000000000",
      "0x10037Fb06Ec4aB8c870a92AE3f00cD58e5D484b3": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"
    }
  }
}
```

In the amount field you can specify either decimal or hex string. This will mint 1000000000000000000 (equivalent of 1 Native Coin denominated as 10^18) to both addresses. Note that these are both in string format. "0xde0b6b3a7640000" hex is equivalent to 1000000000000000000. For further information about precompile initial configurations see [Initial Precompile Configurations](#initial-precompile-configurations).

### Configuring Dynamic Fees[​](#configuring-dynamic-fees "Direct link to heading")

You can configure the parameters of the dynamic fee algorithm on chain using the `FeeConfigManager`. In order to activate this feature, you will need to provide the `FeeConfigManager` in the genesis:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "feeManagerConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

The precompile implements the `FeeManager` interface which includes the same `AllowList` interface used by ContractNativeMinter, TxAllowList, etc. For an example of the `AllowList` interface, see the [TxAllowList](#allowlist-interface) above.

The `Stateful Precompile` contract powering the `FeeConfigManager` adheres to the following Solidity interface at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000003` (you can load this interface and interact directly in Remix). It can be also found in [IFeeManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/5faabfeaa021a64c2616380ed2d6ec0a96c8f96d/contract-examples/contracts/IFeeManager.sol):

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "./IAllowList.sol";

interface IFeeManager is IAllowList {
  struct FeeConfig {
    uint256 gasLimit;
    uint256 targetBlockRate;
    uint256 minBaseFee;
    uint256 targetGas;
    uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator;
    uint256 minBlockGasCost;
    uint256 maxBlockGasCost;
    uint256 blockGasCostStep;
  }
  event FeeConfigChanged(
    address indexed sender,
    FeeConfig oldFeeConfig,
    FeeConfig newFeeConfig
  );

  // Set fee config fields to contract storage
  function setFeeConfig(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 targetBlockRate,
    uint256 minBaseFee,
    uint256 targetGas,
    uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator,
    uint256 minBlockGasCost,
    uint256 maxBlockGasCost,
    uint256 blockGasCostStep
  ) external;

  // Get fee config from the contract storage
  function getFeeConfig()
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint256 gasLimit,
      uint256 targetBlockRate,
      uint256 minBaseFee,
      uint256 targetGas,
      uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator,
      uint256 minBlockGasCost,
      uint256 maxBlockGasCost,
      uint256 blockGasCostStep
    );

  // Get the last block number changed the fee config from the contract storage
  function getFeeConfigLastChangedAt()
    external
    view
    returns (uint256 blockNumber);
}
```

FeeConfigManager precompile uses `IAllowList` interface directly, meaning that it uses the same `AllowList` interface functions like `readAllowList` and `setAdmin`, `setManager`, `setEnabled`, `setNone`. For more information see [AllowList Solidity interface](#allowlist-interface).

In addition to the `AllowList` interface, the FeeConfigManager adds the following capabilities:

- `getFeeConfig`: retrieves the current dynamic fee config
- `getFeeConfigLastChangedAt`: retrieves the timestamp of the last block where the fee config was updated
- `setFeeConfig`: sets the dynamic fee config on chain (see [here](#fee-config) for details on the fee config parameters). This function can only be called by an `Admin`, `Manager` or `Enabled` address.
- `FeeConfigChanged`: an event that is emitted when the fee config is updated. Topics include the sender, the old fee config, and the new fee config.

You can also get the fee configuration at a block with the `eth_feeConfig` RPC method. For more information see [here](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_feeconfig).

#### Initial Fee Config Configuration[​](#initial-fee-config-configuration "Direct link to heading")

It's possible to enable this precompile with an initial configuration to activate its effect on activation timestamp. This provides a way to define your fee structure to take effect at the activation.

To use the initial configuration, you need to specify the fee config in `initialFeeConfig` field in your genesis or upgrade file:

```json
{
  "feeManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "initialFeeConfig": {
      "gasLimit": 20000000,
      "targetBlockRate": 2,
      "minBaseFee": 1000000000,
      "targetGas": 100000000,
      "baseFeeChangeDenominator": 48,
      "minBlockGasCost": 0,
      "maxBlockGasCost": 10000000,
      "blockGasCostStep": 500000
    }
  }
}
```

This will set the fee config to the values specified in the `initialFeeConfig` field. For further information about precompile initial configurations see [Initial Precompile Configurations](#initial-precompile-configurations).

### Changing Fee Reward Mechanisms[​](#changing-fee-reward-mechanisms "Direct link to heading")

Fee reward mechanism can be configured with this stateful precompile contract called as `RewardManager`. Configuration can include burning fees, sending fees to a predefined address, or enabling fees to be collected by block producers. This precompile can be configured as follows in the genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "rewardManagerConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

`adminAddresses` denotes admin accounts who can add other `Admin` or `Enabled` accounts. `Admin`, `Manager` and `Enabled` are both eligible to change the current fee mechanism.

The precompile implements the `RewardManager` interface which includes the `AllowList` interface. For an example of the `AllowList` interface, see the [TxAllowList](#allowlist-interface) above.

The `Stateful Precompile` contract powering the `RewardManager` adheres to the following Solidity interface at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004` (you can load this interface and interact directly in Remix). It can be also found in [IRewardManager.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/5faabfeaa021a64c2616380ed2d6ec0a96c8f96d/contract-examples/contracts/IRewardManager.sol):

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "./IAllowList.sol";

interface IRewardManager is IAllowList {
  // RewardAddressChanged is the event logged whenever reward address is modified
  event RewardAddressChanged(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed oldRewardAddress,
    address indexed newRewardAddress
  );

  // FeeRecipientsAllowed is the event logged whenever fee recipient is modified
  event FeeRecipientsAllowed(address indexed sender);

  // RewardsDisabled is the event logged whenever rewards are disabled
  event RewardsDisabled(address indexed sender);

  // setRewardAddress sets the reward address to the given address
  function setRewardAddress(address addr) external;

  // allowFeeRecipients allows block builders to claim fees
  function allowFeeRecipients() external;

  // disableRewards disables block rewards and starts burning fees
  function disableRewards() external;

  // currentRewardAddress returns the current reward address
  function currentRewardAddress() external view returns (address rewardAddress);

  // areFeeRecipientsAllowed returns true if fee recipients are allowed
  function areFeeRecipientsAllowed() external view returns (bool isAllowed);
}
```

`RewardManager` precompile uses `IAllowList` interface directly, meaning that it uses the same `AllowList` interface functions like `readAllowList` and `setAdmin`, `setEnabled`, `setNone`. For more information see [AllowList Solidity interface](#allowlist-interface).

In addition to the `AllowList` interface, the `RewardManager` adds the following capabilities:

- `setRewardAddress`: sets the address to which fees are sent. This address can be a contract or a user address. The address becomes the required coinbase address for the blocks that this mechanism is enabled on. Meaning that it will receive the fees collected from the transactions in the block. Receiving fees will not call any contract functions or fallback functions. It will simply increase the balance of the address by the amount of fees.  
- `allowFeeRecipients`: enables block producers to claim fees. This will allow block producers to claim fees by specifying their own addresses in their chain configs. See [here](#fee-recipient) for more information on how to specify the fee recipient address in the chain config.
- `disableRewards`: disables block rewards and starts burning fees.
- `currentRewardAddress`: returns the current reward address. This is the address to which fees are sent. It can include black hole address (`0x010...0`) which means that fees are burned. It can also include a predefined hash (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) denoting custom fee recipients are allowed. It's advised to use the `areFeeRecipientsAllowed` function to check if custom fee recipients are allowed first.
- `areFeeRecipientsAllowed`: returns true if custom fee recipients are allowed.
- `RewardAddressChanged`: an event that is emitted when the reward address is updated. Topics include the sender, the old reward address, and the new reward address.
- `FeeRecipientsAllowed`: an event that is emitted when fee recipients are allowed. Topics include the sender.
- `RewardsDisabled`: an event that is emitted when rewards are disabled. Topics include the sender.
    
These 3 mechanisms (burning, sending to a predefined address, and enabling fees to be collected by block producers) cannot be enabled at the same time. Enabling one mechanism will take over the previous mechanism. For example, if you enable `allowFeeRecipients` and then enable `disableRewards`, the `disableRewards` will take over and fees will be burned.

Note that reward addresses or fee recipient addresses are not required to be an admin or enabled account.

#### Initial Configuration[​](#initial-configuration "Direct link to heading")

It's possible to enable this precompile with an initial configuration to activate its effect on activation timestamp. This provides a way to enable the precompile without an admin address to change the fee reward mechanism. This can be useful for networks that require a one-time reward mechanism change without specifying any admin addresses. Without this initial configuration, the precompile will inherit the `feeRecipients` mechanism activated at genesis. Meaning that if `allowFeeRecipients` is set to true in the genesis file, the precompile will be enabled with the `allowFeeRecipients` mechanism. Otherwise it will keep burning fees. To use the initial configuration, you need to specify the initial reward mechanism in `initialRewardConfig` field in your genesis or upgrade file.

In order to allow custom fee recipients, you need to specify the `allowFeeRecipients` field in the `initialRewardConfig`:

```json
{
  "rewardManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "initialRewardConfig": {
      "allowFeeRecipients": true
    }
  }
}
```

In order to set an address to receive all transaction rewards, you need to specify the `rewardAddress` field in the `initialRewardConfig`:

```json
{
  "rewardManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "initialRewardConfig": {
      "rewardAddress": "0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"
    }
  }
}
```

In order to disable rewards and start burning fees, you need to leave all fields in the `initialRewardConfig` empty:

```json
{
  "rewardManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "initialRewardConfig": {}
  }
}
```

However this is different than the default behavior of the precompile. If you don't specify the `initialRewardConfig` field, the precompile will inherit the `feeRecipients` mechanism activated at genesis. Meaning that if `allowFeeRecipients` is set to true in the genesis file, the precompile will be enabled with the `allowFeeRecipients` mechanism. Otherwise it will keep burning fees. Example configuration for this case:

```json
{
  "rewardManagerConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": 0,
    "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
  }
}
```

If `allowFeeRecipients` and `rewardAddress` are both specified in the `initialRewardConfig` field then an error will be returned and precompile won't be activated. For further information about precompile initial configurations see [Initial Precompile Configurations](#initial-precompile-configurations).

### Avalanche Warp Messaging[​](#avalanche-warp-messaging "Direct link to heading")

Warp Precompile enabled cross-subnet communication between other Subnets and primary-network (C-Chain). In order to use Warp messaging, Subnet-EVM chains must activate their Warp precompiles. Warp can be activated with the following lines in upgrade.json:

```json
{
  "warpConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": (uint),
    "quorumNumerator": (uint)
  }
}
```

`blockTimestamp` must be set to a timestamp after Durango date. `quorumNumerator` is the stake percentage of validators that must sign a Warp message for it to be considered valid. It must be set to a value between 33 and 100. The default value is 67. The `warpConfig` precompile can be later disabled by setting `disable` to `true` in the upgrade.json file.

If you want to use Warp messaging in an existing Subnet-EVM chain, you should coordinate an upgrade with `upgrade.json`. See [Network Upgrades: Enable/Disable Precompiles](#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles) for more information.

<Callout type="warn">
Currently Warp Precompile can only be activated in Mainnet after Durango occurs. Durango in Mainnet is set at 11 AM ET (4 PM UTC) on Wednesday, March 6th, 2024. If you plan to use Warp messaging in your own Subnet-EVM chain in Mainnet you should upgrade to `[[email protected]](https://docs.avax.network/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` or later and coordinate your precompile upgrade. Warp Config's "blockTimestamp" must be set after `1709740800`, Durango date (11 AM ET (4 PM UTC) on Wednesday, March 6th, 2024).
</Callout>

Contract Examples[​](#contract-examples "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Subnet-EVM contains example contracts for precompiles under `/contracts`. It's a hardhat project with tests and tasks. For more information see [contract examples README](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/tree/master/contracts#subnet-evm-contracts).

Network Upgrades: Enable/Disable Precompiles[​](#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Callout type="warn">
Performing a network upgrade requires coordinating the upgrade network-wide. A network upgrade changes the rule set used to process and verify blocks, such that any node that upgrades incorrectly or fails to upgrade by the time that upgrade goes into effect may become out of sync with the rest of the network.

Any mistakes in configuring network upgrades or coordinating them on validators may cause the network to halt and recovering may be difficult.
</Callout>

In addition to specifying the configuration for each of the above precompiles in the genesis chain config, they can be individually enabled or disabled at a given timestamp as a network upgrade. Disabling a precompile disables calling the precompile and destructs its storage so it can be enabled at a later timestamp with a new configuration if desired.

These upgrades must be specified in a file named `upgrade.json` placed in the same directory where [`config.json`](#avalanchego-chain-configs) resides: `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json`. For example, `WAGMI Subnet` upgrade should be placed in `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt/upgrade.json`.

The content of the `upgrade.json` should be formatted according to the following:

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "[PRECOMPILE_NAME]": {
        "blockTimestamp": "[ACTIVATION_TIMESTAMP]", // unix timestamp precompile should activate at
        "[PARAMETER]": "[VALUE]" // precompile specific configuration options, eg. "adminAddresses"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
An invalid `blockTimestamp` in an upgrade file results the update failing. The `blockTimestamp` value should be set to a valid Unix timestamp value which is in the _future_ relative to the _head of the chain_. If the node encounters a `blockTimestamp` which is in the past, it will fail on startup.
</Callout>

To disable a precompile, the following format should be used:

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "<precompileName>": {
        "blockTimestamp": "[DEACTIVATION_TIMESTAMP]", // unix timestamp the precompile should deactivate at
        "disable": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each item in `precompileUpgrades` must specify exactly one precompile to enable or disable and the block timestamps must be in increasing order. Once an upgrade has been activated (a block after the specified timestamp has been accepted), it must always be present in `upgrade.json` exactly as it was configured at the time of activation (otherwise the node will refuse to start).

Enabling and disabling a precompile is a network upgrade and should always be done with caution.

<Callout type="warn">
For safety, you should always treat `precompileUpgrades` as append-only.

As a last resort measure, it is possible to abort or reconfigure a precompile upgrade that has not been activated since the chain is still processing blocks using the prior rule set.
</Callout>

If aborting an upgrade becomes necessary, you can remove the precompile upgrade from `upgrade.json` from the end of the list of upgrades. As long as the blockchain has not accepted a block with a timestamp past that upgrade's timestamp, it will abort the upgrade for that node.

### Example[​](#example "Direct link to heading")

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "feeManagerConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 1668950000,
        "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
      }
    },
    {
      "txAllowListConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 1668960000,
        "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
      }
    },
    {
      "feeManagerConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 1668970000,
        "disable": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This example enables the `feeManagerConfig` at the first block with timestamp >= `1668950000`, enables `txAllowListConfig` at the first block with timestamp >= `1668960000`, and disables `feeManagerConfig` at the first block with timestamp >= `1668970000`.

When a precompile disable takes effect (that is, after its `blockTimestamp` has passed), its storage will be wiped. If you want to reenable it, you will need to treat it as a new configuration.

After you have created the `upgrade.json` and placed it in the chain config directory, you need to restart the node for the upgrade file to be loaded (again, make sure you don't restart all Subnet validators at once!). On node restart, it will print out the configuration of the chain, where you can double-check that the upgrade has loaded correctly. In our example:

```bash
INFO [08-15|15:09:36.772] <2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt Chain>
github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/eth/backend.go:155: Initialised chain configuration

Constantinople: 0 Petersburg: 0 Istanbul: 0, Muir Glacier: 0, Subnet EVM: 0, FeeConfig:
{\“gasLimit\“:20000000,\“targetBlockRate\“:2,\“minBaseFee\“:1000000000,\“targetGas\
“:100000000,\“baseFeeChangeDenominator\“:48,\“minBlockGasCost\“:0,\“maxBlockGasCost\
“:10000000,\“blockGasCostStep\“:500000}, AllowFeeRecipients: false, NetworkUpgrades: {\
“subnetEVMTimestamp\“:0}, PrecompileUpgrade: {}, UpgradeConfig: {\"precompileUpgrades\":[{\"feeManagerConfig\":{\"adminAddresses\":[\"0x8db97c7cece249c2b98bdc0226cc4c2a57bf52fc\"],\"enabledAddresses\":null,\"blockTimestamp\":1668950000}},{\"txAllowListConfig\":{\"adminAddresses\":[\"0x8db97c7cece249c2b98bdc0226cc4c2a57bf52fc\"],\"enabledAddresses\":null,\"blockTimestamp\":1668960000}},{\"feeManagerConfig\":{\"adminAddresses\":null,\"enabledAddresses\":null,\"blockTimestamp\":1668970000,\"disable\":true}}]}, Engine: Dummy Consensus Engine}"”
```

Notice that `precompileUpgrades` entry correctly reflects the changes. You can also check the activated precompiles at a timestamp with the [`eth_getActivePrecompilesAt`](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_getactiveprecompilesat) RPC method. The [`eth_getChainConfig`](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api#eth_getchainconfig) RPC method will also return the configured upgrades in the response.

That's it, your Subnet is all set and the desired upgrades will be activated at the indicated timestamp!

### Initial Precompile Configurations[​](#initial-precompile-configurations "Direct link to heading")

Precompiles can be managed by some privileged addresses to change their configurations and activate their effects. For example, the `feeManagerConfig` precompile can have `adminAddresses` which can change the fee structure of the network.

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "feeManagerConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 1668950000,
        "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, only the address `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` is allowed to change the fee structure of the network. The admin address has to call the precompile in order to activate its effect; that is it needs to send a transaction with a new fee config to perform the update. This is a very powerful feature, but it also gives a large amount of power to the admin address. If the address `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC` is compromised, the network is compromised.

With the initial configurations, precompiles can immediately activate their effect on the activation timestamp. With this way admin addresses can be omitted from the precompile configuration. For example, the `feeManagerConfig` precompile can have `initialFeeConfig` to setup the fee configuration on the activation:

```json
{
  "precompileUpgrades": [
    {
      "feeManagerConfig": {
        "blockTimestamp": 1668950000,
        "initialFeeConfig": {
          "gasLimit": 20000000,
          "targetBlockRate": 2,
          "minBaseFee": 1000000000,
          "targetGas": 100000000,
          "baseFeeChangeDenominator": 48,
          "minBlockGasCost": 0,
          "maxBlockGasCost": 10000000,
          "blockGasCostStep": 500000
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that there is no `adminAddresses` field in the configuration. This means that there will be no admin addresses to manage the fee structure with this precompile. The precompile will simply update the fee configuration to the specified fee config when it activates on the `blockTimestamp` `1668950000`.

<Callout title="Note">
It's still possible to add `adminAddresses` or `enabledAddresses` along with these initial configurations. In this case, the precompile will be activated with the initial configuration, and admin/enabled addresses can access to the precompiled contract normally.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Note">
If you want to change the precompile initial configuration, you will need to first disable it then activate the precompile again with the new configuration.
</Callout>

See every precompile initial configuration in their relevant `Initial Configuration` sections under [Precompiles](#precompiles).

AvalancheGo Chain Configs[​](#avalanchego-chain-configs "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As described in [this doc](/docs/nodes/configure/configs-flags#subnet-chain-configs), each blockchain of Subnets can have its own custom configuration. If a Subnet's ChainID is `2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt`, the config file for this chain is located at `{chain-config-dir}/2ebCneCbwthjQ1rYT41nhd7M76Hc6YmosMAQrTFhBq8qeqh6tt/config.json`.

For blockchains created by or forked from Subnet-EVM, most [C-Chain configs](/docs/nodes/configure/chain-configs/c-chain) are applicable except [Avalanche Specific APIs](/docs/nodes/configure/chain-configs/c-chain#enabling-avalanche-specific-apis).

### Priority Regossip[​](#priority-regossip "Direct link to heading")

A transaction is "regossiped" when the node does not find the transaction in a block after `priority-regossip-frequency` (defaults to `1m`). By default, up to 16 transactions (max 1 per address) are regossiped to validators per minute.

Operators can use "priority regossip" to more aggressively "regossip" transactions for a set of important addresses (like bridge relayers). To do so, you'll need to update your [chain config](/docs/nodes/configure/configs-flags#subnet-chain-configs) with the following:

```json
{
  "priority-regossip-addresses": ["<YOUR 0x-ADDRESS>"]
}
```

By default, up to 32 transactions from priority addresses (max 16 per address) are regossipped to validators per second. You can override these defaults with the following config:

```json
{
  "priority-regossip-frequency": "1s",
  "priority-regossip-max-txs": 32,
  "priority-regossip-addresses": ["<YOUR 0x-ADDRESS>"],
  "priority-regossip-txs-per-address": 16
}
```

### Fee Recipient[​](#fee-recipient "Direct link to heading")

This works together with [`allowFeeRecipients`](#setting-a-custom-fee-recipient) and [RewardManager precompile](#changing-fee-reward-mechanisms) to specify where the fees should be sent to.

With `allowFeeRecipients` enabled, validators can specify their addresses to collect fees.

```json
{
  "feeRecipient": "<YOUR 0x-ADDRESS>"
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
If `allowFeeRecipients` or `RewardManager` precompile is enabled on the Subnet, but a validator doesn't specify a "feeRecipient", the fees will be burned in blocks it produces.
</Callout>

Network Upgrades: State Upgrades[​](#network-upgrades-state-upgrades "Direct link to heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subnet-EVM allows the network operators to specify a modification to state that will take place at the beginning of the first block with a timestamp greater than or equal to the one specified in the configuration.

This provides a last resort path to updating non-upgradeable contracts via a network upgrade (for example, to fix issues when you are running your own blockchain).

<Callout type="warn">
This should only be used as a last resort alternative to forking `subnet-evm` and specifying the network upgrade in code.

Using a network upgrade to modify state is not part of normal operations of the EVM. You should ensure the modifications do not invalidate any of the assumptions of deployed contracts or cause incompatibilities with downstream infrastructure such as block explorers.
</Callout>

The timestamps for upgrades in `stateUpgrades` must be in increasing order. `stateUpgrades` can be specified along with `precompileUpgrades` or by itself.

The following three state modifications are supported:

- `balanceChange`: adds a specified amount to the balance of a given account. This amount can be specified as hex or decimal and must be positive.
- `storage`: modifies the specified storage slots to the specified values. Keys and values must be 32 bytes specified in hex, with a `0x` prefix.
- `code`: modifies the code stored in the specified account. The code must _only_ be the runtime portion of a code. The code must start with a `0x` prefix.

<Callout type="warn">
If modifying the code, _only_ the runtime portion of the bytecode should be provided in `upgrades.json`. Do not use the bytecode that would be used for deploying a new contract, as this includes the constructor code as well. Refer to your compiler's documentation for information on how to find the runtime portion of the contract you wish to modify.

Network Upgrades: Rescheduling Mandatory Network Upgrades[​](#network-upgrades-rescheduling-mandatory-network-upgrades "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A typical case when a network misses any mandatory activation would result in a network that is not able to operate. This is because validators/nodes running the old version would process transactions differently than nodes running the new version and end up different state. This would result in a fork in the network and new nodes would not be able to sync with the network. Normally this puts the chain in a halt and requires a hard fork to fix the issue. Starting with Subnet-EVM v0.6.3, you can reschedule mandatory activations like Durango via upgrade configs (upgrade.json in chain directory). This is a very advanced operation and should be done only if your network cannot operate going forward. The reschedule operation should be coordinated with your entire network nodes. Network upgrade overrides can be defined in the `upgrade.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "networkUpgradeOverrides": {
    "{networkUpgrade1}": timestamp1,
    "{networkUpgrade2}": timestamp2,
  }
}
```

The `timestamp` should be a Unix timestamp in seconds.

For instance, if you missed the Durango activation in Fuji (February 13th, 2024, 16:00 UTC) or Mainnet (March 6th, 2024, 16:00 UTC) and having issues in your network, you can reschedule the Durango activation via upgrades. In order to do this, you need to prepare a new upgrade.json including following:

```json
{
  "networkUpgradeOverrides": {
    "durangoTimestamp": 1712419200
  }
}
```

This reschedules the Durango activation to 2024-11-06 16:00:00 UTC (one month later than the actual activation). After preparing the upgrade.json, you need to update the chain directory with the new upgrade.json and restart your nodes. You should see logs similar to the following:

```bash
INFO [03-22|14:04:48.284] <fPypUHjNvJqBKXBx2LEoJ9u5b8rRxMtEhb4v2QEDQejEiTtMG Chain> github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/plugin/evm/vm.go:367: Applying network upgrade overrides overrides="{\"durangoTimestamp\":1712419200}"
...
INFO [03-22|14:04:48.288] <fPypUHjNvJqBKXBx2LEoJ9u5b8rRxMtEhb4v2QEDQejEiTtMG Chain> github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/core/blockchain.go:335: Avalanche Upgrades (timestamp based):
INFO [03-22|14:04:48.288] <fPypUHjNvJqBKXBx2LEoJ9u5b8rRxMtEhb4v2QEDQejEiTtMG Chain> github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/core/blockchain.go:335:  - SubnetEVM Timestamp:           @0          (https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
INFO [03-22|14:04:48.288] <fPypUHjNvJqBKXBx2LEoJ9u5b8rRxMtEhb4v2QEDQejEiTtMG Chain> github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/core/blockchain.go:335:  - Durango Timestamp:            @1712419200 (https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
...
```

This means your node is lock and loaded for the new Durango activation. After the new timestamp is reached, your node will activate Durango and start processing transactions with the new Durango features.

<Callout type="warn">
Nodes running non-compatible version (running pre-Durango version after Durango activation), should be updated to most recent version of Subnet-EVM (v0.6.3+) and must have the new upgrade.json to reschedule the Durango activation. Running a new version without the rescheduling upgrade.json might create a fork in the network.

All of network nodes, even ones correctly upgraded to Durango and running the correct version since Durango activation, should be restarted with the new upgrade.json to reschedule the Durango activation. This is a network-wide operation and should be coordinated with all network nodes.
