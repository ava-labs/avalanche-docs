description: Learn how to get test funds for Avalanche from Faucet.

The [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) sends AVAX to X-Chain or C-Chain addresses to help you test. (This testnet AVAX has no value.)

We can get a "drip" of AVAX from the Fuji faucet. Paste the address into the [Fuji faucet website](https://faucet.avax.network/). These AVAX are for the Fuji Testnet and have no monetary value.

If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet, paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. The faucet will send some AVAX to the address and return a transaction ID (txID). This txID can be used with the Fuji Testnet Explorer to learn more about the transaction.

Otherwise, please request a faucet coupon on [Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6) can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options.
