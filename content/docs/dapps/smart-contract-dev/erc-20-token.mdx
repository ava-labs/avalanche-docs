title: Create an ERC-20 Token
description: Create an ERC-20 Token
---

[ERC-20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) are the most fundamental and essential concept in Ethereum. As the Avalanche community and the ecosystem are growing, new use cases and projects that are running on Ethereum or different chains would be implemented to Avalanche.

Therefore, we will be creating our own mintable ERC-20 token and will mint it to any address we want. The token will be generated on Avalanche C-Chain and will be accessible on that chain. We are using Fuji Testnet in this tutorial.

The article focuses on deploying a smart contract written with Solidity to Avalanche. This is the feature that Avalanche provides us - to be able to deploy any smart contract to the chain and no requirement for a new language specific contract concept to interact. Let's look at how to create an ERC-20 contract and deploy it to avalanche C-Chain.

## Setup Core Wallet

The first thing we should do is to enable Testnet mode on Core. To do that, go to **Settings** and click on **Advanced**.

Here, turn on the **Testnet Mode** feature. This will automatically make Core switch to Fuji Testnet.

<Callout title="Note">
If you are using other wallets, like MetaMask, you can add the Fuji Testnet using the following specs:

- **Network Name**: Avalanche C-Chain
- **New RPC URL**: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
- **ChainID**: `43113`
- **Symbol**: AVAX
- **Explorer**: https://testnet.snowtrace.io
</Callout>

The setup is done. For now, we have 0 AVAX.

## Fund Your C-Chain Address

Avalanche has a [Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) that drips test tokens to the address of your choice. If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet, paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. Otherwise, please request a faucet coupon on [Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6) can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options.

## Create Mintable Token

Now, we can create our mintable token on Remix. Open Remix on your browser or go to [this link](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.6.6+commit.6c089d02.js).

You should view this page. On this page, first, click "SOLIDITY" from "Featured Plugins" and then click the "New File" button. When you click the New File button, you will see a pop-up that requires a file name. You can choose a name or leave the default.

Since we will use an ERC-20 contract from [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/), just paste this line to the file and save.

```solidity
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/presets/ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol";
```

After saving the file, we will see a bunch of files that are imported to remix. This is a remix feature that allows us to import a GitHub contract repository to remix by just giving the URL-link with an import statement.

![Image for post](/images/erc5.png)

We have ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol file in the presets. This file is written by OpenZeppelin according to ERC20 standards with minter functionality. After deploying this file, we will be the owner of the contract and thus have the authority and ability to mint the tokens.

## Deploy the Contract

Open the tab with label `Solidity compiler` and select the solidity version that matches with the solidity version written in file as `pragma solidity â€¦..`. The version should be equal to or higher than the file's version. For example, in my file, `pragma solidity ^0.6.0` is written so the required version is 0.6.0 or higher. As shown, in the compiler the solidity version is 0.6.6, which is OK. After checking the solidity version click the compile button. If you did not change anything in the file, or the solidity version is not wrong, the contract should compile without any errors.

Then, let's jump to the tab with label `Deploy & run transactions`. Here before deploying our contract, we should change the environment. Click to the environment and select "Injected Web3." If a pop-up shows up and asks you to connect the account, click to connect. After, you should see the account address in the "ACCOUNT" text box.

The last thing before the deployment process is to set the contract that will be deployed as a token. Above the Deploy Button, there is a drop-down menu to select a contract. Select the contract named `ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol`.

Now, here enter the name and symbol of your token. I will name it "test" and the symbol will be `tst`. You can give it a and click to transact button.

After clicking the button, a pop-up will show up and just confirm it.

And then another pop-up, a Core confirmation, appears. Confirm it.

After confirming all these pop-ups we have deployed our token to avalanche C-Chain. So we can start to interact with it.

## Interact with Token

We can see our transaction that deployed on avalanche C-Chain via this [c-chain explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/).

But firstly, let's see our transaction hash from the remix console.

![Image for post](/images/erc11.png)

After deploying the contract, we should see a log in remix console. When you click to arrow and expand it, a transaction hash will come up. Copy it.

![Image for post](/images/erc12.png)

Just paste the transaction hash to the [explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) I shared above and press enter.

Here we can see all details about the transaction and token contract.

The first one is my wallet address that creates token and the second address is my token contract address which is named `test`. Now, let's mint some token to our own address.

![Image for post](/images/erc15.png)

Come back to the remix and after deploying, you should be able to see the contract in "Deployed Contracts" section.

Here, we have a bunch of functions that we can use to interact with our token contract. You can check all these methods from OpenZeppelin documentation to learn how to use them. But we will only use the mint method.

Click to arrow beside the mint method to read it.

![Image for post](/images/erc16.png)

Enter your address and an amount in wei. For example, I will mint 1000 `tst` token so, I entered "1000000000000000000000"

## Add Token to Core Wallet

Now we minted 1000 token to our contract, but you should not be able to see the tokens in your Core wallet. In order to see our own token, we have to add it. On Core, click on the Avalanche C-Chain, and then select Manage:

![Add token 1](/images/erc17.png)

![Add token 2](/images/erc18.png)

Click on Add custom token. Here,enter the token address that you can see from the explorer, as showed above. Copy and paste it here. Then click on the Add token button, you should see 1000 token that you named in your Core wallet. Also, you can send it to another account via either remix or Core.
