## Overview

The purpose of this document is to help you with launching your existing dapp on
Avalanche. It contains a series of resources designed to help you get the basics
of Avalanche Platform and how it works, show how to connect to the network, how
to use your existing tools and environments in developing and deploying on
Avalanche, as well as some common pitfalls you need to consider when running
your dapp on Avalanche.

## Accessing Avalanche C-Chain

C-Chain exposes the [same API](/api-reference/c-chain/api) as
`go-ethereum`, so you can use all the familiar APIs that are available on Ethereum
for interaction with the platform.

There are multiple ways of working with the C-Chain.

### Through Core

Powered by Avalanche,
[Core](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-releases-core-an-all-in-one-web3-operating-system-for-avalanche-a844eb822887)
is an all-in-one operating system bringing together Avalanche apps, Avalanche L1s,
bridges, and NFTs in one seamless, high-performance browser experience. Putting
in another way, Core is more than a wallet. It is a curated web3 operating
system combining Wallet, Explorer, Bridge, Avalanche L1s, dApps, and more.

In your application's web interface, follow [this to add Avalanche programmatically](/dapps/advanced-tutorials/add-network-programmatically#core).

### Through MetaMask

You can access C-Chain through MetaMask, by defining a custom network. Go to
MetaMask, log in, click the network dropdown, and select 'Custom RPC'. Data for
Avalanche is as follows.

#### **Avalanche Mainnet Settings:**

- **Network Name**: Avalanche Mainnet C-Chain
- **New RPC URL**: `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
- **ChainID**: `43114`
- **Symbol**: `AVAX`
- **Explorer**: [https://snowtrace.io/](https://snowtrace.io/)

#### **Fuji Testnet Settings:**

- **Network Name**: Avalanche Fuji C-Chain
- **New RPC URL**: `https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
- **ChainID**: `43113`
- **Symbol**: `AVAX`
- **Explorer**: [https://testnet.snowtrace.io/](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)

In your application's web interface, you can
[add Avalanche programmatically](/dapps/advanced-tutorials/add-network-programmatically#metamask)
so your users don't have to enter the network data manually.

### Using the Public API Nodes or RPC Endpoints

Instead of proxying network operations through MetaMask, you can use the public
API, which consists of a number of AvalancheGo nodes behind a load balancer.

The C-Chain API endpoint is
`https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
for the Mainnet and
`https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
for the testnet.

For more information, see [documentation](/tooling/rpc-providers).

However, public API does not expose all the APIs that are available on the node,
as some of them would not make sense on a publicly accessible service, and some
would present a security risk. If you need to use an API that is not available
publicly, you can run your own node.

## Running Your Own Node

If you don't want your dapp to depend on a centralized service you don't
control, or have specific needs that cannot be met through the public API, you
can run your own node and access the network that way. Running your own node
also avoids potential issues with public API congestion and rate-limiting.

For development and experimental purposes,
[here](/nodes/run-a-node/manually) is a tutorial that shows
how to download, build, and install AvalancheGo. Simpler solution is to use the
prebuilt binary, available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases).

If you're going to run a node on a Linux machine, you can use the
[installer script](/nodes/using-install-script/installing-avalanche-go) to install the node as a
`systemd` service. Script also handles node upgrading.

If you want to run a node in a docker container, there are [build
scripts](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/tree/master/scripts) in the
AvalancheGo repo for various Docker configs.

### Node Configuration

Node configuration options are explained
[here](/nodes/configure/configs-flags). But unless you have
specific needs, you can mostly leave the main node config options at their
default values.

On the other hand, you will most likely need to adjust C-Chain configuration to
suit your intended use. You can look up complete configuration options for
C-Chain [here](/nodes/chain-configs/c-chain) as well
as the default configuration. Note that only the options that are different from
their default values need to be included in the config file.

By default, the C-Chain config file is located at
`$HOME/.avalanchego/configs/chains/C/config.json`. We will go over how to adjust
the config to cover some common use cases in the following sections.

#### Running an Archival Node

If you need Ethereum's [Archive
Node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#archive-node)
functionality, you need to disable C-Chain pruning, which is enabled by default
to conserve disk space. To preserve full historical state, include
`"pruning-enabled": false` in the C-Chain config file.

<Callout title="Note">
After changing the flag to disable the database pruning, you will need to run
the bootstrap process again, as the node will not backfill any already pruned
and missing data.

To re-bootstrap the node, stop it, delete the database (by default stored in
`~/.avalanchego/db/`) and start the node again.
</Callout>

#### Running a Node in Debug Mode

By default, debug APIs are disabled. To enable them, you need to enable the
appropriate EVM APIs in the config file by including the `eth-apis` value in
your C-Chain config file to include the `debug`, `debug-tracer`, and
`internal-debug` APIs.

<Callout title="Note">
Including the `eth-apis` in the config flag overrides the defaults, so you need
to include the default APIs as well!
</Callout>

#### Example C-Chain Config File

An example C-Chain config file that includes the archival mode, enables debug
APIs as well as default EVM APIs:

```json
{
  "eth-apis": [
    "eth",
    "eth-filter",
    "net",
    "web3",
    "internal-eth",
    "internal-blockchain",
    "internal-transaction",
    "debug-tracer"
  ],
  "pruning-enabled": false
}
```

Default config values for the C-Chain can be seen [here](/nodes/chain-configs/c-chain).

### Running a Local Test Network

If you need a private test network to test your dapp, [Avalanche Network
Runner](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-network-runner) is a shell client
for launching local Avalanche networks, similar to Ganache on Ethereum.

For more information, see [documentation](/tooling/avalanche-network-runner/introduction).

## Developing and Deploying Contracts

Being an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, all of the usual Ethereum developer
tools and environments can be used to develop and deploy dapps for Avalanche's
C-Chain.

### Remix

There is a
[tutorial](/dapps/smart-contract-dev/deploy-with-remix-ide)
for using Remix to deploy smart contracts on Avalanche. It relies on Core
for access to the Avalanche network.

### thirdweb

You can also use thirdweb to test and deploy smart contracts on Avalanche. Find out how in this [tutorial](/dapps/toolchains/thirdweb).

### Hardhat

Hardhat is the newest development and testing environment for Solidity smart
contracts, and the one our developers use the most. Due to its superb testing
support, it is the recommended way of developing for Avalanche.

For more information see [this doc](/dapps/toolchains/hardhat).

## Avalanche Explorer

An essential part of the smart contract development environment is the explorer,
which indexes and serves blockchain data. Mainnet C-Chain explorer is available
at [https://snowtrace.io/](https://snowtrace.io/) and testnet explorer at
[https://testnet.snowtrace.io/](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/). Besides the web
interface, it also exposes the standard [Ethereum JSON RPC
API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API).

## Avalanche Faucet

For development purposes, you will need test tokens. Avalanche has a
[Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/) that drips test tokens to the address of
your choice. If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet,
paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. Otherwise,
please request a faucet coupon on
[Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6)
can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options.

If you need, you can also run a faucet locally, but building it from the [repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-faucet).

## Contract Verification

Smart contract verification provides transparency for users interacting with
smart contracts by publishing the source code, allowing everyone to attest that
it really does what it claims to do. You can verify your smart contracts using
the [C-Chain explorer](https://snowtrace.io/). The procedure is simple:

- navigate to your published contract address on the explorer
- on the `code` tab select `verify & publish`
- copy and paste the flattened source code and enter all the build parameters exactly as they are on the published contract
- click `verify & publish`

If successful, the `code` tab will now have a green checkmark, and your users
will be able to verify the contents of your contract. This is a strong positive
signal that your users can trust your contracts, and it is strongly recommended
for all production contracts.

See
[this](/dapps/verify-contract/hardhat)
for a detailed tutorial with Hardhat.

## Contract Security Checks

Due to the nature of distributed apps, it is very hard to fix bugs once the
application is deployed. Because of that, making sure your app is running
correctly and securely before deployment is of great importance. Contract
security reviews are done by specialized companies and services. They can be
very expensive, which might be out of reach for single developers and startups.
But, there are also automated services and programs that are free to use.

Most popular are:

- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), here's a [tutorial](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/19/slither-a-solidity-static-analysis-framework/)
- [MythX](https://mythx.io/)
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)

We highly recommend using at least one of them if professional contract security
review is not possible. A more comprehensive look into secure development
practices can be found
[here](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/development-guidelines/workflow.md).

## Gotchas and Things to Look out For

Avalanche Platform's C-Chain is EVM-compatible, but it is not identical. There
are some differences you need to be aware of, otherwise, you may create subtle
bugs or inconsistencies in how your dapps behave.

Here are the main differences you should be aware of.

### Measuring Time

Avalanche does not use the same mechanism to measure time as Ethereum which uses
consistent block times. Instead, Avalanche supports asynchronous block issuance,
block production targets a rate of every 2 seconds. If there is sufficient
demand, a block can be produced earlier. If there is no demand, a block will not
be produced until there are transactions for the network to process.

Because of that, you should not measure the passage of time by the number of
blocks that are produced. The results will not be accurate, and your contract
may be manipulated by third parties.

Instead of block rate, you should measure time simply by reading the timestamp
attribute of the produced blocks. Timestamps are guaranteed to be monotonically
increasing and to be within 30 seconds of the real time.

### Finality

On Ethereum, the blockchain can be reorganized and blocks can be orphaned, so
you cannot rely on the fact that a block has been accepted until it is several
blocks further from the tip (usually, it is presumed that blocks 6 places deep
are safe). That is not the case on Avalanche. Blocks are either accepted or
rejected within a second or two. And once the block has been accepted, it is
final, and cannot be replaced, dropped, or modified. So the concept of 'number
of confirmations' on Avalanche is not used. As soon as a block is accepted and
available in the explorer, it is final.

### Using `eth_newFilter` and Related Calls with the Public API

If you're using the
[`eth_newFilter`](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_newfilter) API method on the
public API server, it may not behave as you expect because the public API is
actually several nodes behind a load balancer. If you make an `eth_newFilter`
call, subsequent calls to
[`eth_getFilterChanges`](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_getfilterchanges) may
not end up on the same node as the first call, and you will end up with
undefined results.

If you need the log filtering functionality, you should use a websocket
connection, which ensures that your client is always talking to the same node
behind the load balancer. Alternatively, you can use
[`eth_getLogs`](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_getlogs), or run your own node
and make API calls to it.
