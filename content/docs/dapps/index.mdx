description: Learn about the Avalanche C-Chain.
---

Avalanche is a [network of networks](/docs/quick-start/primary-network). One of the chains running on Avalanche Primary Network is an EVM fork called the C-Chain (contract chain).

C-Chain runs a fork of [`go-ethereum`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server) called [`coreth`](https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth) that has the networking and consensus portions replaced with Avalanche equivalents. What's left is the Ethereum VM, which runs Solidity smart contracts and manages data structures and blocks on the chain.

As a result, you get a blockchain that can run all the Solidity smart contracts from Ethereum, but with much greater transaction bandwidth and instant finality that [Avalanche's revolutionary consensus](/docs/quick-start/avalanche-consensus) enables.

Coreth is loaded as a plugin into [AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego), the client node application used to run Avalanche network. Any dApp deployed to Avalanche C-Chain will function the same as on Ethereum, but much faster and cheaper.
