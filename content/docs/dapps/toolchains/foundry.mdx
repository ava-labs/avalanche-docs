description: Deploy and interact with smart contracts using foundry on a local Avalanche Network and the Fuji C-Chain.
---

[Foundry toolchain](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a smart contract development toolchain written in Rust. It manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line.

## Recommended Knowledge

- Basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) and Avalanche.
- You are familiar with [Avalanche Smart Contract Quickstart](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart).
- Basic understanding of the [Avalanche's architecture](/docs/learn/primary-network)
- performed a cross-chain swap via this [this tutorial](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6169872-how-to-make-a-cross-chain-transfer-in-the-avalanche-wallet) to get funds to your C-Chain address.

## Requirements

- You have [installed Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) and run `foundryup`. This installation includes the `forge` and `cast` binaries used in this walk-through.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) version `16.x`

### AvalancheGo and Avalanche Network Runner

[AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) is an Avalanche node implementation written in Go.

[Avalanche Network Runner](/docs/tooling/avalanche-network-runner/introduction) is a tool to quickly deploy local test networks. Together, you can deploy local test networks and run tests on them.

Start a local five node Avalanche network:

```bash
cd /path/to/avalanche-network-runner
# start a five node staking network
./go run examples/local/fivenodenetwork/main.go
```

A five node Avalanche network is running on your machine. Network will run until you press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

## Getting Started

This section will walk you through creating an [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

### Clone Avalanche Smart Contract Quick Start

Clone the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart) and install the necessary packages via `yarn`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git
cd avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
yarn install
```

<Callout title="Note">
The repository cloning method used is HTTPS, but SSH can be used too:

`git clone [[email protected]](https://docs.avax.network/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git`

You can find more about SSH and how to use it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).
</Callout>

In order to deploy contracts, you need to have some AVAX. You can get testnet AVAX from the [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/), which is an easy way to get to play around with Avalanche. If you already have an AVAX balance greater than zero on Mainnet, paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens. Otherwise, please request a faucet coupon on [Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6) can provide testnet AVAX if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options. After getting comfortable with your code, you can run it on Mainnet after making the necessary changes to your workflow.

## Write Contracts

We will use our example ERC721 smart contract, [`NFT.sol`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/3fbba0ac28f6420e9be5d2635d5f23693f80127a/contracts/NFT.sol) found in `./contracts` of our project.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// contracts/ERC721.sol

pragma solidity >=0.6.2;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract NFT is ERC721 {
  using Counters for Counters.Counter;
  Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

  constructor() ERC721("GameItem", "ITM") {}

  // commented out unused variable
  // function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI)
  function awardItem(address player)
    public
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _tokenIds.increment();

    uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
    _mint(player, newItemId);
    // _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

    return newItemId;
  }
}
```

Let's examine this implementation of an NFT as a Game Item. We start by importing to contracts from our node modules. We import OpenZeppelin's open source implementation of the [ERC721 standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721) which our NFT contract will inherit from. Our constructor takes the `_name` and `_symbol` arguments for our NFT and passes them on to the constructor of the parent ERC721 implementation. Lastly we implement the `awardItem` function which allows anyone to mint an NFT to a player's wallet address. This function increments the `currentTokenId` and makes use of the `_mint` function of our parent contract.

## Compile, Deploy, and Verify with Forge

[Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-build.html) is a command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts.

It requires some initial project configuration in the form of a [foundry.toml](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#configuration) which can be generated by running:

```bash
forge init --no-git --no-commit --force
```

The `foundry.toml` by default points to the folders it added. We will want to change this to make sure the `src` points to the `contracts` directory. Change your `foundry.toml` to look like the following:

```toml title="foundry.toml"
[profile.default]
src = 'contracts'
out = 'out'
libs = ["node_modules", "lib"]
remappings = [
    '@ensdomains/=node_modules/@ensdomains/',
    '@openzeppelin/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/',
    'hardhat/=node_modules/hardhat/',
]
```

By default, the contract artifacts will be in the `out` directory, as specified in the `foundry.toml`. To deploy our compiled contract with Forge, we have to set environment variables for the RPC endpoint and the private key we want to use to deploy.

Set your environment variables by running:

```bash
export RPC_URL=<YOUR-RPC-ENDPOINT>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>
```

Since we are deploying to Fuji testnet, our `RPC_URL` export should be:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

If you would like to verify you contracts during the deployment process (fastest and easiest way), get a [Snowtrace API Key](https://docs.snowtrace.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics). Add this as an environment variable:

```bash
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<YOUR-SNOWTRACE-API-KEY>
```

Once set, you can [deploy your NFT with Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create.html) by running the command below while adding the values for `_name` and `_symbol`, the relevant [constructor arguments](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/3ad93abf50fba65e3aab68f23382bcace73968be/contracts/NFT.sol#L13) of the NFT contract. You can verify the contracts with Snowtrace by adding `--verify` before the `--constructor-args`:

```bash
forge create NFT --rpc-url=$RPC_URL --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY --verify --constructor-args GameItem ITM
```

Upon successful deployment, you will see the deploying wallet's address, the contract's address as well as the transaction hash printed to your terminal.

Here's an example output from an NFT deployment and verification.

```bash
[â ”] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: 0x8db97c7cece249c2b98bdc0226cc4c2a57bf52fc

```

Upon successful verification, after your deployment you will see the contract verification status as `successfully verified`:

```bash
Starting contract verification...
Waiting for etherscan to detect contract deployment...

```

Note: Please store your `Deployed to` address for use in the next sections.

## Verifying After Deployment

If you did not verify within the deployment process, you can still verify a deployed contract with foundry, using [`forge verify-contract`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-verify-contract). The `foundry.toml` and environment variables will have to be set like they were in the previous section.

For example, if we were to verify the NFT contract we just deployed in the previous section it would look this:

```bash
forge verify-contract --chain-id 43113 --watch --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(string,string)" "GameItem" "ITM") 0x8e982a4ef70430f8317b5652bd5c28f147fbf912 NFT
```

Upon successful verification, you will see the contract verification status as `successfully verified`:

```bash
Starting contract verification...
Waiting for etherscan to detect contract deployment...
Start verifying contract `0x8e982a4ef70430f8317b5652bd5c28f147fbf912` deployed on fuji

```

## Using Cast to Interact with the Smart Contract

We can call functions on our NFT contract with [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send.html), Foundry's command-line tool for interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions, and getting chain data. In this scenario, we will mint a Game Item to a player's wallet using the [`awardItem` function](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/0f29cbb6375a1a452579213f688609c880d52c01/contracts/NFT.sol#L17) in our smart contract.

Mint an NFT from your contract by replacing `<NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS>` with your `Deployed to` address and `<NFT-RECIPIENT-ADDRESS>` with an address of your choice.

_Note: This section assumes that you have already set your RPC and private key env variables during deployment_

```bash
cast send --rpc-url=$RPC_URL  <NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS> "awardItem(address)" <NFT-RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY
```

Upon success, the command line will display the [transaction data](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0x4651ae041a481a6eeb852e5300e9be48e66a1d2332733df22d8e75cf460b0c2c).

Well done! You just minted your first NFT from your contract. You can check the owner of `tokenId` 1 by running the `cast call` command below:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url=$RPC_URL --private-key=$PRIVATE_KEY <NFT-CONTRACT-ADDRESS> "ownerOf(uint256)" 1
```

The address you provided above should be returned as the owner.

```bash
0x000000000000000000000000845095a03a6686e24b90fed55e11f4ec808b1ab3
```

## Mainnet Workflow

The Fuji workflow above can be adapted to Mainnet with the following modifications to the environment variables:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
export PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>
```

## Local Workflow

The Fuji workflow above can be adapted to a Local Network by doing following:

In a new terminal navigate to your [Avalanche Network Runner](/docs/tooling/avalanche-network-runner/introduction) directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/Avalanche-Network-Runner
```

Next, deploy a new Avalanche Network with five nodes (a Cluster) locally.

```bash
go run examples/local/fivenodenetwork/main.go
```

Next, modify the environment variables in your Foundry project:

```bash
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
export PRIVATE_KEY=56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027
```

<Callout type="warn">
The example PRIVATE_KEY variable above provides a pre-funded account on Avalanche Network Runner and should be used for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
</Callout>

## Summary

Now you have the tools you need to launch a local Avalanche network, create a Foundry project, as well as create, compile, deploy and interact with Solidity contracts.
