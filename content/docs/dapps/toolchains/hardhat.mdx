description: Learn how to write, test and deploy smart contracts to Avalanche's C-Chain with Hardhat.
---

The goal of this guide is to lay out best practices regarding writing, testing and deployment of smart contracts to Avalanche's C-Chain. We'll be building smart contracts with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Prerequisites

### NodeJS and Yarn

First, install the LTS (long-term support) version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). This is `18.x` at the time of writing. NodeJS bundles `npm`.

Next, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### AvalancheGo and Avalanche Network Runner

[AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) is an Avalanche node implementation written in Go. [Avalanche Network Runner](/tooling/avalanche-network-runner/introduction) is a tool to quickly deploy local test networks. Together, you can deploy local test networks and run tests on them.

### Solidity and Avalanche

It is also helpful to have a basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) and Avalanche.

## Dependencies

Clone the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart) and install the necessary packages via `yarn`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git
cd avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
yarn install
```

<Callout title="Note">
The repository cloning method used is HTTPS, but SSH can be used too:

`git clone [[email protected]](https://docs.avax.network/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart.git`

You can find more about SSH and how to use it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).
</Callout>

## Write Contracts

Edit the `ExampleERC20.sol` contract in `contracts/`. `ExampleERC20.sol` is an [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) contract. ERC20 is a popular smart contract interface. You can also add your own contracts.

## Hardhat Config

Hardhat uses `hardhat.config.js` as the configuration file. You can define tasks, networks, compilers and more in that file. For more information see [here](https://hardhat.org/config/).

Here is an example pre-configured `hardhat.config.ts`.

```ts title="hardhat.config.ts"
import { task } from "hardhat/config";
import { SignerWithAddress } from "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import { BigNumber } from "ethers";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle";

// When using the hardhat network, you may choose to fork Fuji or Avalanche Mainnet
// This will allow you to debug contracts using the hardhat network while keeping the current network state
// To enable forking, turn one of these booleans on, and then run your tasks/scripts using ``--network hardhat``
// For more information go to the hardhat guide
// https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/
// https://hardhat.org/guides/mainnet-forking.html
const FORK_FUJI = false;
const FORK_MAINNET = false;
const forkingData = FORK_FUJI
  ? {
      url: "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
    }
  : FORK_MAINNET
  ? {
      url: "https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
    }
  : undefined;

export default {
  solidity: {
    compilers: [
      {
        version: "0.5.16",
      },
      {
        version: "0.6.2",
      },
      {
        version: "0.6.4",
      },
      {
        version: "0.7.0",
      },
      {
        version: "0.8.0",
      },
    ],
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      gasPrice: 225000000000,
      chainId: !forkingData ? 43112 : undefined, //Only specify a chainId if we are not forking
      forking: forkingData,
    },
    local: {
      url: "http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc",
      gasPrice: 225000000000,
      chainId: 43112,
      accounts: [
        "0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027",

      ],
    },
    fuji: {
      url: "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
      gasPrice: 225000000000,
      chainId: 43113,
      accounts: [],
    },
    mainnet: {
      url: "https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
      gasPrice: 225000000000,
      chainId: 43114,
      accounts: [],
    },
  },
};
```

This configures necessary network information to provide smooth interaction with Avalanche. There are also some pre-defined private keys for testing on a local test network.

<Callout title="Note">
The port in this tutorial uses 9650. Depending on how you start your local network, it could be different.
</Callout>

## Hardhat Tasks

You can define custom hardhat tasks in `hardhat.config.ts`. There are two tasks included as examples: `accounts` and `balances`.

```ts title="hardhat.config.ts"
task(
  "accounts",
  "Prints the list of accounts",
  async (args, hre): Promise<void> => {
    const accounts: SignerWithAddress[] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    accounts.forEach((account: SignerWithAddress): void => {
      console.log(account.address);
    });
  }
);

task(
  "balances",
  "Prints the list of AVAX account balances",
  async (args, hre): Promise<void> => {
    const accounts: SignerWithAddress[] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    for (const account of accounts) {
      const balance: BigNumber = await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(
        account.address
      );
      console.log(`${account.address} has balance ${balance.toString()}`);
    }
  }
);
```

- `npx hardhat accounts` prints the list of accounts.
- `npx hardhat balances` prints the list of AVAX account balances.

As with other `yarn` scripts, you can pass in a `--network` flag to hardhat tasks.

### Accounts

Prints a list of accounts on the local Avalanche Network Runner network.

```bash
npx hardhat accounts --network local
0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
0x9632a79656af553F58738B0FB750320158495942
0x55ee05dF718f1a5C1441e76190EB1a19eE2C9430
0x4Cf2eD3665F6bFA95cE6A11CFDb7A2EF5FC1C7E4
0x0B891dB1901D4875056896f28B6665083935C7A8
0x01F253bE2EBF0bd64649FA468bF7b95ca933BDe2
0x78A23300E04FB5d5D2820E23cc679738982e1fd5
0x3C7daE394BBf8e9EE1359ad14C1C47003bD06293

0x0Fa8EA536Be85F32724D57A37758761B86416123
```

### Balances

Prints a list of accounts and their corresponding AVAX balances on the local Avalanche Network Runner network.

```bash
npx hardhat balances --network local
0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC has balance 50000000000000000000000000
0x9632a79656af553F58738B0FB750320158495942 has balance 0
0x55ee05dF718f1a5C1441e76190EB1a19eE2C9430 has balance 0
0x4Cf2eD3665F6bFA95cE6A11CFDb7A2EF5FC1C7E4 has balance 0
0x0B891dB1901D4875056896f28B6665083935C7A8 has balance 0
0x01F253bE2EBF0bd64649FA468bF7b95ca933BDe2 has balance 0
0x78A23300E04FB5d5D2820E23cc679738982e1fd5 has balance 0
0x3C7daE394BBf8e9EE1359ad14C1C47003bD06293 has balance 0
0x61e0B3CD93F36847Abbd5d40d6F00a8eC6f3cfFB has balance 0
0x0Fa8EA536Be85F32724D57A37758761B86416123 has balance 0
```

Notice that the first account is already funded. This is because this address is pre-funded in the local network genesis file.

### ERC20 Balances

```ts title="hardhat.config.ts"
task(
  "check-erc20-balance",
  "Prints out the ERC20 balance of your account"
).setAction(async function (taskArguments, hre) {
  const genericErc20Abi = require("./erc20.abi.json");
  const tokenContractAddress = "0x...";
  const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider(
    "https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc"
  );
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(
    tokenContractAddress,
    genericErc20Abi,
    provider
  );
  const balance = await contract.balanceOf("0x...");
  console.log(`Balance in wei: ${balance}`);
});
```

This will return the result in wei. If you want to know the exact amount of token with its token name then you need to divide it with its decimal. `erc20.abi.json` can be [found here](https://docs.avax.network/assets/files/erc20.abi-a562e36ad30a4d751911073568ea0546.json).

The example uses the [C-Chain Public API](/api-reference/c-chain/api#endpoints) for the provider. For a local Avalanche network use `http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc` and for Fuji Testnet use `https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`.

## Hardhat Help

Run `yarn hardhat` to list Hardhat's version, usage instructions, global options and available tasks.

## Typical Avalanche Network Runner Workflow

### Run Avalanche Network Runner

First confirm you have the latest AvalancheGo built.

```bash
cd /path/to/avalanchego
git fetch -p
git checkout master
./scripts/build.sh
```

(Note that you can also [download pre-compiled AvalancheGo binaries](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases) rather than building from source.)

Confirm you have Avalanche Network Runner installed by following the steps listed [here](/tooling/avalanche-network-runner/introduction)

Start Avalanche Network Runner and run a script to start a new local network.

### Start the Server

```bash
cd /path/to/Avalanche-Network-Runner

# next command
avalanche-network-runner server \
--log-level debug \
--port=":8080" \
--grpc-gateway-port=":8081"
```

### Start a New Avalanche Network with Five Nodes

```bash
# replace execPath with the path to AvalancheGo on your machine
# e.g., ${HOME}/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/avalanchego

AVALANCHEGO_EXEC_PATH="avalanchego"
```

```bash
avalanche-network-runner control start \
--log-level debug \
--endpoint="0.0.0.0:8080" \
--number-of-nodes=5 \
--avalanchego-path ${AVALANCHEGO_EXEC_PATH}
```

Now you're running a local Avalanche network with 5 nodes.

### Fund Accounts

Transfer 1,000 AVAX from the X-Chain to each of the 10 accounts in `hardhat.config.ts` with the script [`fund-cchain-addresses`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/scripts/fund-cchain-addresses.js). Funding these accounts is a prerequisite for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

Note: If you see `Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: "API call rejected because chain is not done bootstrapping"`, you need to wait until network is bootstrapped and ready to use. It should not take too long.

```bash
cd /path/to/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart
yarn fund-cchain-addresses
```

Confirm each of the accounts are funded with 1000 AVAX.

```bash
yarn balances --network local

# output
yarn run v1.22.4
npx hardhat balances --network local

✨  Done in 0.72s.
```

Send each of the accounts some AVAX from the first account.

```bash
yarn send-avax-wallet-signer --network local

# output
yarn run v1.22.4
npx hardhat run scripts/sendAvaWalletSigner.ts --network local
Seeding addresses with AVAX

```

Confirm that the balances are updated

```bash
yarn balances --network local

# output
yarn run v1.22.4
npx hardhat balances --network local

```

Note: If you see `Error HH108: Cannot connect to the network local. Please make sure your node is running, and check your internet connection and networks config`, ensure that you are using a valid Node Port. See which ports the Nodes are using by running the command:

```bash
cd /path/to/avalanche-network-runner

# next command
avalanche-network-runner control uris \
--log-level debug \
--endpoint="0.0.0.0:8080"
```

### Compile Smart Contracts

In [`package.json`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/package.json) there's a `compile` script.

```json title="package.json"
"compile": "npx hardhat compile",
```

Run `yarn compile` to make sure your project compiles.

```bash
yarn compile

# output
yarn run v1.22.4
rimraf ./build/
npx hardhat compile
Compiling 1 file with 0.6.4
Compilation finished successfully
✨  Done in 2.13s.
```

## Deploy Smart Contracts

Hardhat enables deploying to multiple environments. In [package.json](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/package.json) there is a script for deploying.

Edit the deployment script in `scripts/deploy.ts`

```ts
"deploy": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts"
```

You can choose which environment that you want to deploy to by passing in the `--network` flag with `local` (for example a local network created with Avalanche Network Runner), `fuji`, or `mainnet` for each respective environment. If you don't pass in `--network` then it will default to the hardhat network. For example, if you want to deploy to Mainnet:

```bash
yarn deploy --network mainnet
```

Deploy the contract to your local network:

```bash
yarn deploy --network local

# output
yarn run v1.22.4
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network local
Coin deployed to: 0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6
✨  Done in 1.28s.
```

We now have a token deployed at `0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6`.

### Interact with Smart Contract

Hardhat has a developer console to interact with contracts and the network. For more information about Hardhat's console see [here](https://hardhat.org/guides/hardhat-console.html). Hardhat console is a NodeJS-REPL, and you can use different tools in it. [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) is the library that we'll use to interact with our network.

You can open console with:

```bash
yarn console --network local

# output
yarn run v1.22.11
npx hardhat console --network local
Welcome to Node.js v16.2.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
```

Get the contract instance with factory and contract address to interact with our contract:

```js
> const Coin = await ethers.getContractFactory('ExampleERC20');
undefined
> const coin = await Coin.attach('0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6')
undefined
```

The first line retrieves contract factory with ABI & bytecode. The second line retrieves an instance of that contract factory with given contract address. Recall that our contract was already deployed to `0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6` in the previous step.

Fetch the accounts:

```js
> let accounts = await ethers.provider.listAccounts()
undefined
> accounts
[
  '0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC',
  '0x9632a79656af553F58738B0FB750320158495942',
  '0x55ee05dF718f1a5C1441e76190EB1a19eE2C9430',
  '0x4Cf2eD3665F6bFA95cE6A11CFDb7A2EF5FC1C7E4',
  '0x0B891dB1901D4875056896f28B6665083935C7A8',
  '0x01F253bE2EBF0bd64649FA468bF7b95ca933BDe2',
  '0x78A23300E04FB5d5D2820E23cc679738982e1fd5',
  '0x3C7daE394BBf8e9EE1359ad14C1C47003bD06293',
  '0x61e0B3CD93F36847Abbd5d40d6F00a8eC6f3cfFB',
  '0x0Fa8EA536Be85F32724D57A37758761B86416123'
]
```

This is exactly the same account list as in `yarn accounts`.

Now we can interact with our `ERC-20` contract:

```js
> let value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[0])
undefined
> value.toString()
'123456789'
> value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[1])
BigNumber { _hex: '0x00', _isBigNumber: true }
> value.toString()
'0'
```

`account[0]` has a balance because `account[0]` is the default account. The contract is deployed with this account. The constructor of [ERC20.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol) mints `TOTAL_SUPPLY` of 123456789 token to the deployer of the contract.

`accounts[1]` currently has no balance. Send some tokens to `accounts[1]`, which is `0x9632a79656af553F58738B0FB750320158495942`.

```js
> let result = await coin.transfer(accounts[1], 100)
undefined
> result
{
  hash: '0x35eec91011f9089ba7689479617a90baaf8590395b5c80bb209fa7000e4848a5',
  type: 0,
  accessList: null,
  blockHash: null,
  blockNumber: null,
  transactionIndex: null,
  confirmations: 0,

Note: Since this is a local network, we did not need to wait until transaction is accepted. However for other networks like `fuji` or `mainnet` you need to wait until transaction is accepted with: `await result.wait()`.

Now we can ensure that tokens are transferred:

```js
> value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[0])
BigNumber { _hex: '0x075bccb1', _isBigNumber: true }
> value.toString()
'123456689'
> value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[1])
BigNumber { _hex: '0x64', _isBigNumber: true }
> value.toString()
'100'
```

As you might noticed there was no "sender" information in `await coin.transfer(accounts[1], 100)`; this is because `ethers` uses the first signer as the default signer. In our case this is `account[0]`. If we want to use another account we need to connect with it first.

```js
> let signer1 = await ethers.provider.getSigner(1)
> let contractAsSigner1 = coin.connect(signer1)
```

Now we can call the contract with `signer1`, which is `account[1]`.

```js
> await contractAsSigner1.transfer(accounts[0], 5)

Let's check balances now:

```js
> value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[0])
BigNumber { _hex: '0x075bccb6', _isBigNumber: true }
> value.toString()
'123456694'
> value = await coin.balanceOf(accounts[1])
BigNumber { _hex: '0x5f', _isBigNumber: true }
> value.toString()
'95'
```

We've successfully transferred 5 tokes from `accounts[1]` to `accounts[0]`
