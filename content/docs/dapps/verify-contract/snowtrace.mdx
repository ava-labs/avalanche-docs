title: Using Snowtrace
description: Learn how to verify a contract on the Avalanche C-chain using Snowtrace.
---

The C-Chain Explorer supports verifying smart contracts, allowing users to review it. The Mainnet C-Chain Explorer is [here](https://snowtrace.io/) and the Fuji Testnet Explorer is [here.](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)

If you have issues, contact us on [Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org/).

## Steps

Navigate to the _Contract_ tab at the Explorer page for your contract's address.

Click _Verify & Publish_ to enter the smart contract verification page.

[Libraries](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/contracts.html?highlight=libraries#libraries) can be provided. If they are, they must be deployed, independently verified and in the _Add Contract Libraries_ section.

The C-Chain Explorer can fetch constructor arguments automatically for simple smart contracts. More complicated contracts might require you to pass in special constructor arguments. Smart contracts with complicated constructors [may have validation issues](/docs/dapps/smart-contract-dev/verify-contract/snowtrace#caveats). You can try this [online ABI encoder](https://abi.hashex.org/).

## Requirements

- **IMPORTANT** Contracts should be verified on Testnet before being deployed to Mainnet to ensure there are no issues.
- Contracts must be flattened. Includes will not work.
- Contracts should be compile-able in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). A flattened contract with `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2` (as an example) can create unusual binary and/or constructor blobs. This might cause validation issues.
- The C-Chain Explorer **only** validates [solc JavaScript](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin) and only supports [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) contracts.

## Libraries

The compile bytecode will identify if there are external libraries. If you released with Remix, you will also see multiple transactions created.

```
{
  "linkReferences": {
    "contracts/Storage.sol": {
      "MathUtils": [
        {
          "length": 20,
          "start": 3203
        }
        ...
      ]
    }
  },
  "object": "....",
  ...
}
```

This requires you to add external libraries in order to verify the code.

A library can have dependent libraries. To verify a library, the hierarchy of dependencies will need to be provided to the C-Chain Explorer. Verification may fail if you provide more than the library plus any dependencies (that is you might need to prune the Solidity code to exclude anything but the necessary classes).

You can also see references in the byte code in the form `__$75f20d36....$__`. The keccak256 hash is generated from the library name.

Example [online converter](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html): `contracts/Storage.sol:MathUtils` => `75f20d361629befd780a5bd3159f017ee0f8283bdb6da80805f83e829337fd12`

## Examples

- [SwapFlashLoan](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x12DF75Fed4DEd309477C94cE491c67460727C0E8/contracts)

SwapFlashLoan uses `swaputils` and `mathutils`:

- [SwapUtils](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x6703e4660E104Af1cD70095e2FeC337dcE034dc1/contracts)

SwapUtils requires mathutils:

- [MathUtils](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xbA21C84E4e593CB1c6Fe6FCba340fa7795476966/contracts)

## Caveats

### SPDX License Required

An SPDX must be provided.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: ...
```

### `keccak256` Strings Processed

The C-Chain Explorer interprets all keccak256(...) strings, even those in comments. This can cause issues with constructor arguments.

```solidity
/// keccak256("1");
keccak256("2");
```

This could cause automatic constructor verification failures. If you receive errors about constructor arguments they can be provided in ABI hex encoded form on the contract verification page.

### Solidity Constructors

Constructors and inherited constructors can cause problems verifying the constructor arguments. Example:

```solidity
abstract contract Parent {
  constructor () {
    address msgSender = ...;
    emit Something(address(0), msgSender);
  }
}
contract Main is Parent {
  constructor (
          string memory _name,
          address deposit,
          uint fee
  ) {
    ...
  }
}
```

If you receive errors about constructor arguments, they can be provided in ABI hex encoded form on the contract verification page.
