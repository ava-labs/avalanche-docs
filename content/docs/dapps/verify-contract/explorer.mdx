description: Learn how to verify a smart contract using the official Avalanche Explorer.
---

This document outlines the process of verifying a Smart Contract deployed on the Avalanche Network using the official explorer.

## Contract Deployment

1. Compile the smart contract using the tooling of your choice.

2. Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Avalanche network.
   - This can be done on either the mainnet or testnet (depending on your RPC configuration)

3. Upon successful deployment, you will receive:
   - A transaction hash
   - A contract address

<Callout title="Note">
Ensure you save the contract address as it will be required for the verification process.
</Callout>

## Contract Verification

1. Navigate to the official [Avalanche Explorer](https://subnets.avax.network/) and click on **Tools** dropdown menu to select **Smart Contract Verification*** interface. You may need to open the [Testnet Explorer](https://subnets-test.avax.network/) in case the contract is deployed on Fuji Testnet.

2. Prepare the following files:
   - The contract's Solidity file (`.sol`)
   - The `metadata.json` file containing the ABI and metadata

3. Upload the required files:
   - Upload the contract's Solidity file
   - Upload the `metadata.json` file

4. Enter the contract address:
   - Paste the contract address obtained from the deployment step into the designated input field.

5. Initiate verification:
   - Click on the **Submit Contract** button to start the verification process.

## Next Steps

After submitting the contract for verification, your request will be processed shortly and you will see the below message.
