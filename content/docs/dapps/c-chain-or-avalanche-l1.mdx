## When to Build on C-Chain

Here are some advantages of the Avalanche C-Chain that you should take into account.

### High Composability with C-Chain Assets[​](#we-want-high-composability-with-c-chain-assets "Direct link to heading")

C-Chain is a better option for seamless integration with existing C-Chain assets and contracts. It is easier to build a DeFi application on C-Chain, as it provides larger liquidity pools and thus allows for efficient exchange between popular assets.

### Low Initial Cost[​](#we-want-low-initial-cost "Direct link to heading")

C-Chain has economic advantages of low-cost deployment and cheap transactions. The recent Etna upgrade trim down the base fee of Avalanche C-Chain by 25x, which results in much lower transaction costs.

### Low Operational Costs[​](#we-want-low-operational-costs "Direct link to heading")

C-Chain is run and operated by thousands of nodes, it is highly decentralized and reliable, and all the infrastructure (explorers, indexers, exchanges, bridges) has already been built out by dedicated teams that maintain them for you at no extra charge. Project deployed on the C-Chain can leverage all of that basically for free.

### High Security[​](#we-want-high-security "Direct link to heading")

The security of Avalanche Primary Network is a function of the security of the underlying validators and stake delegators. You can choose C-Chain in order to achieve maximum security by utilizing thousands of Avalanche Primary Network validators.

## Conclusion

If an application has relatively low transaction rate and no special circumstances that would make the C-Chain a non-starter, you can begin with C-Chain deployment to leverage existing technical infrastructure, and later expand to an Avalanche L1. That way you can focus on working on the core of your project and once you have a solid product/market fit and have gained enough traction that the C-Chain is constricting you, plan a move to your own Avalanche L1.
