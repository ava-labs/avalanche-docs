title: On Avalanche Mainnet
description: Deploy an Avalanche L1 to Avalanche Mainnet
---
<Callout type="warn">
Deploying an Avalanche L1 to Mainnet has many risks. Doing so safely requires a laser focus on security. This tutorial does its best to point out common pitfalls, but there may be other risks not discussed here.

This tutorial is an educational resource and provides no guarantees that following it results in a secure deployment. Additionally, this tutorial takes some shortcuts that aid the understanding of the deployment process at the expense of security. The text highlights these shortcuts and they shouldn't be used for a production deployment.
</Callout>

After managing a successful Avalanche L1 deployment on the `Fuji Testnet`, you're ready to deploy your Avalanche L1 on Mainnet. If you haven't done so, first [Deploy an Avalanche L1 on Testnet](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet).

This tutorial shows how to do the following on `Mainnet`.

- Create an Avalanche L1.
- Deploy a virtual machine based on Subnet-EVM.
- Join a node to the newly created Avalanche L1.
- Add a node as a validator to the Avalanche L1.

<Callout title="Note">
All IDs in this article are for illustration purposes only. They are guaranteed to be different in your own run-through of this tutorial.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- 5+ nodes running and [fully bootstrapped](/docs/nodes) on `Mainnet`
- [Avalanche-CLI is installed](/docs/tooling/guides/get-avalanche-cli) on each validator node's box
- A [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) device
- You've [created an Avalanche L1 configuration](/avalanche-l1s/build-first-avalanche-l1#create-your-avalanche-l1-configuration) and fully tested a [Fuji Testnet Avalanche L1 deployment](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet)

<Callout type="warn">
Although only one validator is strictly required to run an Avalanche L1, running with less than five validators is extremely dangerous and guarantees network downtime. Plan to support at least five validators in your production network.
</Callout>

### Getting Your Mainnet NodeIDs[​](#getting-your-mainnet-nodeids "Direct link to heading")

You need to collect the NodeIDs for each of your validators. This tutorial uses these NodeIDs in several commands.

To get the NodeID of a `Mainnet` node, call the [info.getNodeID](/api-reference/info-api#infogetnodeid) endpoint. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

The response should look something like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "nodeID": "NodeID-5mb46qkSBj81k9g9e4VFjGGSbaaSLFRzD"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

In the sample response, `NodeID-5mb46qkSBj81k9g9e4VFjGGSbaaSLFRzD` is the NodeID. Note that the `NodeID-` prefix is part of the NodeID.

### Setting up Your Ledger[​](#setting-up-your-ledger "Direct link to heading")

In the interest of security, all Avalanche-CLI `Mainnet` operations require the use of a connected Ledger device. You must unlock your Ledger and run the Avalanche App. See [How to Use Ledger](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/6150237-how-to-use-a-ledger-nano-s-or-nano-x-with-avalanche) for help getting set up.

Avalanche-CLI supports the Ledger `Nano X`, `Nano S`, and `Nano S Plus`.

Ledger devices support TX signing for any address inside a sequence automatically generated by the device.

By default, Avalanche-CLI uses the first address of the derivation, and that address needs funds to issue the TXs to create the Avalanche L1 and add validators.

To get the first `Mainnet` address of your Ledger device, first make sure it is connected, unblocked, and running the Avalanche app. Then execute the `key list` command:

```bash
avalanche key list --ledger 0 --mainnet
```

```bash
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
|  KIND  |  NAME   |          CHAIN          |                    ADDRESS                    | BALANCE | NETWORK |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
| ledger | index 0 | P-Chain (Bech32 format) | P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j |      11 | Mainnet |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
```

The command prints the P-Chain address for `Mainnet`, `P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j`, and its balance. You should fund this address with at least 2.5 AVAX to cover TX fees. the TX fee for creating your Avalanche L1 costs 2 AVAX. Adding validators costs 0.001 AVAX each. For more details, see [Fees](/api-reference/standards/guides/txn-fees)

<Callout title="Note">
You can use the `key list` command to get any Ledger address in the derivation sequence by changing the index parameter from `0` to the one desired, or to a list of them (for example: `2`, or `0,4,7`). Also, you can ask for addresses on `Fuji` with the `--fuji` parameter, and local networks with the `--local` parameter.
</Callout>

#### Funding the Ledger[​](#funding-the-ledger "Direct link to heading")

A new Ledger device has no funds on the addresses it controls. You'll need to send funds to it by exporting them from C-Chain to the P-Chain using [Core web](https://core.app/) connected to [Core extension](https://join.core.app/extension).

You can load the Ledger's C-Chain address in Core extension, or load in a different private key to [Core extension](https://join.core.app/extension), and then connect to Core web .

You can move test funds from the C-Chain to the P-Chain by clicking Stake on Core web , then Cross-Chain Transfer (find more details on [this tutorial](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/8133713-core-web-how-do-i-make-cross-chain-transfers-in-core-stake)).

Deploy the Avalanche L1[​](#deploy-the-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

With your Ledger unlocked and running the Avalanche app, run

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy testblockchain
```

This is going to start a new prompt series.

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to deploy on:
    Local Network
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

This tutorial is about deploying to `Mainnet`, so navigate with the arrow keys to `Mainnet` and hit enter.

```bash
✔ Mainnet
Deploying [testblockchain] to Mainnet
```

After that, CLI shows the `Mainnet` Ledger address used to fund the deployment:

```bash
Ledger address: P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

The deployment requires running a `createSubnet` transaction and a `createBlockchain` transaction, and so this first Ledger address must have the funds to issue both operations.

This tutorial creates a permissioned Avalanche L1. As such, you must specify which P-Chain addresses can control the Avalanche L1. These addresses are known as `Control Keys`. The CLI can automatically set your Ledger's address as the sole control key or the user may specify a custom list.

<Callout type="warn">
In production Avalanche L1s, you should always use multiple control keys running in a multisig configuration. This tutorial uses a single control key for illustrative purposes only.

For instructions on controlling your Avalanche L1 with a multisig, see the [Multisig Deployment Tutorial](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/multisig-auth).
</Callout>

```bash
Configure which addresses may make changes to the Avalanche L1.
These addresses are known as your control keys. You are going to also
set how many control keys are required to make an Avalanche L1 change (the threshold).
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? How would you like to set your control keys?:
  ▸ Use ledger address
    Custom list
```

For this tutorial, opt to use the first Ledger address, so enter at `Use ledger address`. Only this address is going to be able to add or remove validators, or create blockchains on the Avalanche L1.

```bash
Your Avalanche L1's control keys: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
Your Avalanche L1 auth keys for chain creation: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
```

Next, the CLI generates a TX for creating the SubnetID and asks the user to sign it by using the Ledger.

```bash
*** Please sign Avalanche L1 creation hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

If the Ledger doesn't have enough funds, the user may see an error message:

```bash
*** Please sign Avalanche L1 creation hash on the ledger device ***
Error: insufficient funds: provided UTXOs need 1000000000 more units of asset "U8iRqJoiJm8xZHAacmvYyZVwqQx6uDNtQeP3CQ6fcgQk3JqnK"
```

If successful, the CLI next asks you to sign a chain creation TX.

```bash
Avalanche L1 has been created with ID: 2UUCLbdGqawRDND7kHjwq3zXXMPdiycG2bkyuRzYMnuTSDr6db. Now creating blockchain...
*** Please sign blockchain creation hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

After that, CLI creates the blockchain within the Avalanche L1, and a summary window for the deployment appears:

```bash
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Well done. You have just created your own Avalanche L1 running on `Mainnet`. Now it's time to add your validators.

Request to Join an Avalanche L1 as a Validator[​](#request-to-join-a-avalanche-l1-as-a-validator "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new Avalanche L1 created in the previous steps doesn't have any dedicated validators yet. To request permission to validate an Avalanche L1, the following steps are required:

<Callout title="Note">
Adding a validator on an Avalanche L1 requires that the node is already a validator on the primary network, which means that your node has **fully bootstrapped**.

See [here](/docs/nodes/validate/node-validator#add-a-validator-with-core-extension) on how to become a validator.
</Callout>

First, request permission to validate by running the `join` command along with the Avalanche L1 name:

```bash
avalanche blockchain join testblockchain
```

Note: Running `join` does not guarantee that your node is a validator of the Avalanche L1! The owner of the Avalanche L1 must approve your node to be a validator afterwards by calling `addValidator` as described in the next section.

### Select Mainnet[​](#select-mainnet "Direct link to heading")

When you `join` command, you are first prompted with the network selection. Choose `Mainnet`:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to validate on (this command only supports public networks):
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

### Setup Node Automatically[​](#setup-node-automatically "Direct link to heading")

There are now two choices possible: automatic and Manual configuration. As mentioned earlier, "Automatic" attempts to edit your config file and sets up your plugin directory, while "Manual" just prints the required config to the screen. If you are running the CLI on the same box as your validator, you should run the commands in automated mode. If you don't want to run Avalanche-CLI on the same box as your validator, use the manual commands.

Select automatic.

#### Set Config File[​](#set-config-file "Direct link to heading")

```bash
✔ Automatic
✔ Path to your existing config file (or where it's going to be generated): config.json
```

Provide a path to a config file. If this command runs on the box where your validator is running, then you could point this to the actually used config file, for example `/etc/avalanchego/config.json` - just make sure the tool has **write** access to the file. Or you could just copy the file later. In any case, the tool is going to either try to edit the existing file specified by the given path, or create a new file. Again, set write permissions.

#### Set Plugin Directory[​](#set-plugin-directory "Direct link to heading")

Next, provide the plugin directory. Each VM runs its own binary, called a plugin. Therefore, you need to copy your VM's plugin binary into AvalancheGo's plugin directory. This directory depends on your AvalancheGo install location.

```bash
✔ Path to your avalanchego plugin dir (likely avalanchego/build/plugins): /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins
```

The tool doesn't know where exactly it's located so it requires the full path. With the path given, it's going to copy the VM binary to the provided location:

```bash
✔ Path to your avalanchego plugin dir (likely avalanchego/build/plugins): /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins█
VM binary written to /home/user/go/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/build/plugins/tGBrMADESojmu5Et9CpbGCrmVf9fiAJtZM5ZJ3YVDj5JTu2qw
This is going to edit your existing config file. This edit is nondestructive,
but it's always good to have a backup.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Proceed?:
  ▸ Yes
    No
```

Hitting `Yes` writes the necessary file:

```bash
✔ Yes
The config file has been edited. To use it, make sure to start the node with the '--config-file'
option, e.g.

./build/avalanchego --config-file config.json

(using your binary location). The node has to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
```

#### Restart the Node[​](#restart-the-node "Direct link to heading")

It's **required to restart the node**.

### Setup Node Manually[​](#setup-node-manually "Direct link to heading")

By choosing "Manual" instead, the tool prints _instructions_. The user is going to have to follow these instructions and apply them to the node. Note that the IDs for the VM and Avalanche L1 are different for each Avalanche L1 deployment and you shouldn't copy them from this tutorial.

```bash
✔ Manual

To setup your node, you must do two things:

1. Add your VM binary to your node's plugin directory
2. Update your node config to start validating the Avalanche L1

To add the VM to your plugin directory, copy or scp from /tmp/tGBrMADESojmu5Et9CpbGCrmVf9fiAJtZM5ZJ3YVDj5JTu2qw

If you installed avalanchego manually, your plugin directory is likely
avalanchego/build/plugins.

If you start your node from the command line WITHOUT a config file (e.g. via command
line or systemd script), add the following flag to your node's startup command:

--track-subnets=2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H
(if the node already has a track-subnets config, append the new value by
comma-separating it).

For example:
./build/avalanchego --network-id=Mainnet --track-subnets=2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H

If you start the node via a JSON config file, add this to your config file:
track-subnets: 2b175hLJhGdj3CzgXENso9CmwMgejaCQXhMFzBsm8hXbH2MF7H

TIP: Try this command with the --avalanchego-config flag pointing to your config file,
this tool is going to try to update the file automatically (make sure it can write to it).

After you update your config, you are going to need to restart your node for the changes to
take effect.
```

Add a Validator[​](#add-a-validator "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------

<Callout type="warn">
If the `join` command isn't successfully completed before `addValidator` is completed, the Avalanche L1 could experience degraded performance or even halt.
</Callout>

Now that the node has joined the Avalanche L1, an Avalanche L1 control key holder must call `addValidator` to grant the node permission to be a validator in your Avalanche L1.

To whitelist a node as a recognized validator on the Avalanche L1, run:

```bash
avalanche blockchain addValidator testblockchain
```

You need to repeat this process for every validator you add to the network.

You can run the `addValidator` transactions from the same box that deployed the Avalanche L1.

### Submit addValidator TX to Mainnet[​](#submit-addvalidator-tx-to-mainnet "Direct link to heading")

First choose `Mainnet` as the network to add the Avalanche L1 validator to.

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to add validator to.:
    Fuji
  ▸ Mainnet
```

Because this operation issues a new transaction, the CLI needs the control keys to sign the operation. Because this tutorial only uses one control key in the Avalanche L1, the process looks slightly different if you use multiple controls keys. The address needs to pay a TX fee of 0.001 AVAX.

```bash
Your Avalanche L1 auth keys for add validator tx creation: [P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j]
```

### Set NodeID[​](#set-nodeid "Direct link to heading")

Now enter the [NodeID](#getting-your-mainnet-nodeids) of the validator.

```bash
Next, we need the NodeID of the validator you want to whitelist.

Check https://docs.avax.network/apis/avalanchego/apis/info#infogetnodeid for instructions about how
to query the NodeID from your node
(Edit host IP address and port to match your deployment, if needed).
✔ What is the NodeID of the validator you'd like to whitelist?: NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg█
```

Note, this ID is intentionally modified to prevent replication.

### Set Stake Weight[​](#set-stake-weight "Direct link to heading")

Select 30 as the stake weight.

<Callout type="warn">
The stake weight of all your validators should sum to at least 100.
</Callout>

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? What stake weight would you like to assign to the validator?:
    Default (20)
  ▸ Custom
```

```bash
✔ What stake weight would you like to assign to the validator?: 30
```

### Set Validation Start Time[​](#set-validation-start-time "Direct link to heading")

Next, specify when the validator is going to start validating. The time must be in the future. You can use the custom option to enter a specific date in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. Follow the default this time:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Start time:
  ▸ Start in one minute
    Custom
```

### Set Validation Duration[​](#set-validation-duration "Direct link to heading")

Finally, specify how long it's going to be validating:

```bash
✔ Start in one minute
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? How long should your validator validate for?:
  ▸ Until primary network validator expires
    Custom
```

If you choose `Custom` here, you need to enter a **duration**, which is a time span expressed in hours. For example, say `200 days = 24 \* 200 = 4800h`

```bash
✔ How long should this validator be validating? Enter a duration, e.g. 8760h: 4800h
```

The CLI shows the user an actual date:

```bash
? Your validator is going to finish staking by 2023-06-10 13:07:58:
  ▸ Yes
    No
```

Confirm if correct.

### Issue the TX[​](#issue-the-tx "Direct link to heading")

At this point the prompt series is complete and the CLI attempts the transaction:

```bash
NodeID: NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg
Network: Mainnet
Start time: 2022-11-22 13:07:58
End time: 2023-06-10 13:07:58
Weight: 30
Inputs complete, issuing transaction to add the provided validator information...
```

The CLI shows the Ledger address:

```bash
Ledger address: P-avax1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

At this point, if the Ledger address isn't the control key for the Avalanche L1, the user receives an error:

```bash
Error: wallet doesn't contain Avalanche L1 auth keys
exit status 1
```

If the Ledger doesn't have enough funds, the following error message appears:

```bash
*** Please sign Avalanche L1 creation hash on the ledger device ***
Error: insufficient funds: provided UTXOs need 1000000 more units of asset "U8iRqJoiJm8xZHAacmvYyZVwqQx6uDNtQeP3CQ6fcgQk3JqnK"
```

Otherwise, both the CLI and the Ledger request to sign the TX:

```bash
*** Please sign add validator hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

This might take a couple of seconds. After, it prints:

```bash
Transaction successful, transaction ID: r3tJ4Wr2CWA8AaticmFrKdKgAs5AhW2wwWTaQHRBZKwJhsXzb
```

This means the node is now a validator on the given Avalanche L1 on `Mainnet`! However, your work isn't complete. You **must** finish the [Request to Join an Avalanche L1 as a Validator](#request-to-join-a-avalanche-l1-as-a-validator) section otherwise your Avalanche L1 risks downtime.

You can get the P-Chain TX id information on [Avalanche Explorer](https://subnets.avax.network/)

Avalanche L1 Export[​](#avalanche-l1-export "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------

Because you need to setup multiple validators on multiple different machines, you need to export your Avalanche L1's configuration and import it on each validator.

```bash
avalanche blockchain export testblockchain
✔ Enter file path to write export data to: /tmp/testblockchain-export.dat
```

The file is in text format and you shouldn't change it. You can use it to import the configuration on a different machine.

Avalanche L1 Import[​](#avalanche-l1-import "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------

To import a VM configuration, move the file you exported in the previous section to your desired machine and issue the `import` command with the path to the file.

```bash
avalanche blockchain import /tmp/testblockchain-export.dat
Avalanche L1 imported successfully
```

After this the whole Avalanche L1 configuration should be available on the target machine:

```bash
avalanche blockchain list
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
|    Avalanche L1     |     CHAIN     | CHAIN ID |   TYPE    | DEPLOYED |
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
| testblockchain    | testblockchain    |     3333 | SubnetEVM | No       |
+---------------+---------------+----------+-----------+----------+
```

Going Live[​](#going-live "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

Once all of your validators have joined the network, you are ready to issue transactions to your Avalanche L1.

For the safety of your validators, you should setup dedicated API nodes to process transactions, but for test purposes, you can issue transactions directly to one of your validator's RPC interface.
