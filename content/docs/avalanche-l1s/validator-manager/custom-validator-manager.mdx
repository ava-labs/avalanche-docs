description: Learn how to implement a custom Validator Manager on your Avalanche L1 blockchain.
---

The Validator Manager contracts provide a framework for managing validators on an Avalanche L1 blockchain, as defined in [ACP-77](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets). `ValidatorManager.sol` is the top-level abstract contract that provides basic functionality. Developers can build upon it to implement custom logic for validator management tailored to their specific requirements.

## Building a Custom Validator Manager

To implement custom validator management logic, you can create a new contract that inherits from `ValidatorManager` or one of its derived contracts (`PoSValidatorManager`, `PoAValidatorManager`, etc.). By extending these contracts, you can override existing functions or add new ones to introduce your custom logic.

**Inherit from the Base Contract**

   Decide which base contract suits your needs. If you require Proof-of-Stake functionality, consider inheriting from `PoSValidatorManager`. For Proof-of-Authority, `PoAValidatorManager` might be appropriate. If you need basic functionality, you can inherit directly from `ValidatorManager`.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import "./ValidatorManager.sol";

   contract CustomValidatorManager is ValidatorManager {
       // Your custom logic here
   }
   ```

### Override Functions

Override existing functions to modify their behavior. Ensure that you adhere to the function signatures and access modifiers.

```solidity
function initializeValidatorRegistration() public override {
    // Custom implementation
}
```
### Add Custom Functions

Introduce new functions that implement the custom logic required for your blockchain.

```solidity
function customValidatorLogic(address validator) public {
    // Implement custom logic
}
```
### Modify Access Control

Adjust access control as needed using modifiers like onlyOwner or by implementing your own access control mechanisms.

```solidity
modifier onlyValidator() {
    require(isValidator(msg.sender), "Not a validator");
    _;
}
```

### Integrate with the P-Chain

Ensure that your custom contract correctly constructs and handles Warp messages for interaction with the P-Chain, following the specifications in ACP-77.

### Testing

Thoroughly test your custom Validator Manager contract to ensure it behaves as expected and adheres to the required protocols.

Example: Custom Reward Logic
Suppose you want to implement a custom reward distribution mechanism. You can create a new contract that inherits from PoSValidatorManager and override the reward calculation functions.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./PoSValidatorManager.sol";

contract CustomRewardValidatorManager is PoSValidatorManager {
    function calculateValidatorReward(address validator) internal view override returns (uint256) {
        // Implement custom reward calculation logic
        return super.calculateValidatorReward(validator) * 2; // Example: double the reward
    }

    function calculateDelegatorReward(address delegator) internal view override returns (uint256) {
        // Implement custom delegator reward calculation logic
        return super.calculateDelegatorReward(delegator) / 2; // Example: halve the reward
    }
}
```

### Considerations
**Security Audits**: Custom contracts should be audited to ensure security and correctness.

**Compliance with ACP-77**: Ensure your custom logic complies with the specifications of ACP-77 to maintain compatibility with Avalanche's protocols.

**Upgradeable Contracts**: If you plan to upgrade your contract in the future, follow best practices for upgradeable contracts.

### Conclusion
Building on top of `ValidatorManager.sol` allows you to customize validator management to fit the specific needs of your Avalanche L1 blockchain. By extending and modifying the base contracts, you can implement custom staking mechanisms, reward distribution, and access control tailored to your application.
