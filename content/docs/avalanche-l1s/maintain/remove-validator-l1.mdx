### Remove a Validator from an Avalanche L1

```bash
avalanche blockchin removeValidator <blockchainName>
```

#### Choose the Network
Choose the network where the validator is registered.
```bash
? Choose a network for the operation: 
  ▸ Local Network
    Devnet
    Fuji Testnet
    Mainnet
```

#### Choose P-Chain fee payer
Choose the key to pay for the transaction fees on the P-Chain.
```bash
? Which key should be used to pay for transaction fees on P-Chain?: 
  ▸ Use stored key
    Use ledger
```

#### Enter Node-ID of the validator to remove
Enter the Node-ID of the validator you want to remove.
```bash
✗ What is the NodeID of the node you want to remove as a blockchain validator?: 
```
<Callout>
You can find the NodeID in the node's configuration file or the console when first started with avalanchego.
An example of a NodeID is `NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg`
</Callout>

#### Confirm the removal
```bash
Validator manager owner 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC pays for the initialization of the validator's removal (Blockchain gas token)

### Proof of Authority Networks
<Callout>
If the network is a Proof of Authority network, the validator must be removed from the network by the Validator Manager owner.
</Callout>

### Proof of Stake Networks
<Callout>
If the network is a Proof of Stake network, the validator must be removed by the initial staker. Rewards will be distributed to the validator after the removal.
It is important to note that the initial PoS Validator set are treated as bootstrap validators and are not elgible for rewards.
