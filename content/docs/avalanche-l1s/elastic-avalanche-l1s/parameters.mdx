Avalanche Permissioned Avalanche L1s can be turned into Elastic Avalanche L1s via the `TransformSubnetTx` transaction. `TransformSubnetTx` specifies a set of structural parameters for the Elastic Avalanche L1.

This reference document describes these structural parameters and illustrates the constraints they must satisfy.

## Elastic Avalanche L1 Parameters

### `Subnet`

`Subnet` has type `ids.ID` and it's the Avalanche L1 ID (SubnetID). `Subnet` is the ID of the `CreateSubnetTx` transaction that created the Avalanche L1 in the first place. The following constraints apply:

- `Subnet` must be different from `PrimaryNetworkID`.

### `AssetID`

`AssetID` has type `ids.ID` and it's the ID of the asset to use when staking on the Avalanche L1. The following constraints apply:

- `AssetID` must not be the `Empty ID`.
- `AssetID` must not be `AVAX ID`, the Primary Network asset.

### `InitialSupply`

`InitialSupply` has type `uint64` and it's the initial amount of `AssetID` transferred in the Elastic Avalanche L1 upon its transformation. Such amount is available for distributing staking rewards. The following constraints apply:

- `InitialSupply` must be larger than zero.

### `MaximumSupply`

`MaximumSupply` has type `uint64` and it's the maximum amount of `AssetID` that Avalanche L1 has available for staking and rewards at any time. The following constraints apply:

- `MaximumSupply` must be larger or equal to `InitialSupply`.

an Avalanche L1 supply can vary in time but it should be no larger than the configured maximum at any point in time, including at Avalanche L1 creation.

### `MinConsumptionRate`

`MinConsumptionRate` has type `uint64` and it's the minimal rate a validator can earn if the `UptimeRequirement` is satisfied. If `StakingPeriod` == `MinStakeDuration`, the validator will earn the `MinConsumptionRate`.

You can find more details about it in the [Reward Formula section](#reward-formula). The following constraints apply:

- `MinConsumptionRate` must be smaller or equal to `PercentDenominator`.

See [Notes on Percentages](#notes-on-percentages) section to understand `PercentDenominator` role.

### `MaxConsumptionRate`

`MaxConsumptionRate` has type `uint64` and it's the maximal rate a validator can earn if the `UptimeRequirement` is satisfied. If `StakingPeriod` == `MaxStakeDuration` == `MintingPeriod`, the validator will earn the `MaxConsumptionRate`.

You can find more details about it in the [Reward Formula section](#reward-formula). The following constraints apply:

- `MaxConsumptionRate` must be larger or equal to `MinConsumptionRate`.
- `MaxConsumptionRate` must be smaller or equal to `PercentDenominator`.

See [Notes on Percentages](#notes-on-percentages) section to understand `PercentDenominator` role.

### `MinValidatorStake`

`MinValidatorStake` has type `uint64` and it's the minimum amount of funds required to become a validator. The following constraints apply:

- `MinValidatorStake` must be larger than zero
- `MinValidatorStake` must be smaller or equal to `InitialSupply`

### `MaxValidatorStake`

`MaxValidatorStake` has type `uint64` and it's the maximum amount of funds a single validator can be allocated, including delegated funds. The following constraints apply:

- `MaxValidatorStake` must be larger or equal to `MinValidatorStake`
- `MaxValidatorStake` must be smaller or equal to `MaximumSupply`

### `MinStakeDuration`

`MinStakeDuration` has type `uint32` and it's the minimum number of seconds a staker can stake for. The following constraints apply:

- `MinStakeDuration` must be larger than zero.

### `MaxStakeDuration`

`MaxStakeDuration` has type `uint32` and it's the maximum number of seconds a staker can stake for. The following constraints apply:

- `MaxStakeDuration` must be larger or equal to `MinStakeDuration`.
- `MaxStakeDuration` must be smaller or equal to `GlobalMaxStakeDuration`.

`GlobalMaxStakeDuration` is defined in genesis and applies to both the Primary Network and all Avalanche L1s.

Its Mainnet value is $365 \times 24 \times time.Hour$.

### `MinDelegationFee`

`MinDelegationFee` has type `uint32` and it's the minimum fee rate a delegator must pay to its validator for delegating. `MinDelegationFee` is a percentage; the actual fee is calculated multiplying the fee rate for the delegator reward. The following constraints apply:

- `MinDelegationFee` must be smaller or equal to `PercentDenominator`.

The `MinDelegationFee` rate applies to Primary Network as well. Its Mainnet value is $2\%$.

### `MinDelegatorStake`

`MinDelegatorStake` has type `uint64` and it's the minimum amount of funds required to become a delegator. The following constraints apply:

- `MinDelegatorStake` must be larger than zero.

### `MaxValidatorWeightFactor`

`MaxValidatorWeightFactor` has type `uint8` and it's the factor which calculates the maximum amount of delegation a validator can receive. A value of 1 effectively disables delegation. You can find more details about it in the [Delegators Weight Checks section](#delegators-weight-checks). The following constraints apply:

- `MaxValidatorWeightFactor` must be larger than zero.

### `UptimeRequirement`

`UptimeRequirement` has type `uint32` and it's the minimum percentage of its staking time that a validator must be online and responsive for to receive a reward. The following constraints apply:

- `UptimeRequirement` must be smaller or equal `PercentDenominator`.

See [Notes on Percentages](#notes-on-percentages) section to understand `PercentDenominator` role.

## Reward Formula

Consider an Elastic Avalanche L1 validator which stakes a $Stake$ amount `AssetID` for $StakingPeriod$ seconds.

Assume that at the start of the staking period there is a $Supply$ amount of `AssetID` in the Avalanche L1. The maximum amount of Avalanche L1 asset is $MaximumSupply$ `AssetID`.

Then at the end of its staking period, a responsive Elastic Avalanche L1 validator receives a reward calculated as follows:

$$
Reward = \left(MaximumSupply - Supply \right) \times \frac{Stake}{Supply} \times \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period} \times EffectiveConsumptionRate
$$

where,

$$
MaximumSupply - Supply = \text{the number of tokens left to emit in the avalanche-l1}
$$

$$
\frac{Stake}{Supply} = \text{the individual's stake as a percentage of all available tokens in the network}
$$

$$
\frac{StakingPeriod}{MintingPeriod} = \text{time tokens are locked up divided by the $MintingPeriod$}
$$

$$
\text{$MintingPeriod$ is one year as configured by the Primary Network).}
$$

$$
EffectiveConsumptionRate =
$$

$$
\frac{MinConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator} \times \left(1- \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period}\right) + \frac{MaxConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator} \times \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period}
$$

Note that $StakingPeriod$ is the staker's entire staking period, not just the staker's uptime, that is the aggregated time during which the staker has been responsive. The uptime comes into play only to decide whether a staker should be rewarded; to calculate the actual reward only the staking period duration is taken into account.

$EffectiveConsumptionRate$ is the rate at which the validator is rewarded based on $StakingPeriod$ selection.

$MinConsumptionRate$ and $MaxConsumptionRate$ bound $EffectiveConsumptionRate$:

$$
MinConsumptionRate \leq EffectiveConsumptionRate \leq MaxConsumptionRate
$$

The larger $StakingPeriod$ is, the closer $EffectiveConsumptionRate$ is to $MaxConsumptionRate$. The smaller $StakingPeriod$ is, the closer $EffectiveConsumptionRate$ is to $MinConsumptionRate$.

A staker achieves the maximum reward for its stake if $StakingPeriod$ = $Minting Period$. The reward is:

$$
Max Reward = \left(MaximumSupply - Supply \right) \times \frac{Stake}{Supply} \times \frac{MaxConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator}
$$

Note that this formula is the same as the reward formula at the top of this section because $EffectiveConsumptionRate$ = $MaxConsumptionRate$.

The reward formula above is used in the Primary Network to calculate stakers reward. For reference, you can find Primary network parameters in [the section below](#primary-network-parameters-on-mainnet).

## Delegators Weight Checks

There are bounds set of the maximum amount of delegators' stake that a validator can receive.

The maximum weight $MaxWeight$ a validator $Validator$ can have is:

$$
MaxWeight = \min(Validator.Weight \times MaxValidatorWeightFactor, MaxValidatorStake)
$$

where $MaxValidatorWeightFactor$ and $MaxValidatorStake$ are the Elastic Avalanche L1 Parameters described above.

A delegator won't be added to a validator if the combination of their weights and all other validator's delegators' weight is larger than $MaxWeight$. Note that this must be true at any point in time.

Note that setting $MaxValidatorWeightFactor$ to 1 disables delegation since the $MaxWeight = Validator.Weight$.

## Notes on Percentages

`PercentDenominator = 1_000_000` is the denominator used to calculate percentages.

It allows you to specify percentages up to 4 digital positions. To denominate your percentage in `PercentDenominator` just multiply it by `10_000`. For example:

- `100%` corresponds to `100 * 10_000 = 1_000_000`
- `1%` corresponds to `1* 10_000 = 10_000`
- `0.02%` corresponds to `0.002 * 10_000 = 200`
- `0.0007%` corresponds to `0.0007 * 10_000 = 7`

## Primary Network Parameters on Mainnet

An Elastic Avalanche L1 is free to pick any parameters affecting rewards, within the constraints specified above. For reference we list below Primary Network parameters on Mainnet:

- `AssetID = Avax`
- `InitialSupply = 240_000_000 Avax`
- `MaximumSupply = 720_000_000 Avax`.
- `MinConsumptionRate = 0.10 * reward.PercentDenominator`.
- `MaxConsumptionRate = 0.12 * reward.PercentDenominator`.
- `Minting Period = 365 * 24 * time.Hour`.
- `MinValidatorStake = 2_000 Avax`.
- `MaxValidatorStake = 3_000_000 Avax`.
- `MinStakeDuration = 2 * 7 * 24 * time.Hour`.
- `MaxStakeDuration = 365 * 24 * time.Hour`.
- `MinDelegationFee = 20000`, that is `2%`.
- `MinDelegatorStake = 25 Avax`.
- `MaxValidatorWeightFactor = 5`. This is a platformVM parameter rather than a genesis one, so it's shared across networks.
- `UptimeRequirement = 0.8`, that is `80%`.

### Interactive Graph

The graph below demonstrates the reward as a function of the length of time
staked. The x-axis depicts $\frac{StakingPeriod}{MintingPeriod}$ as a percentage
while the y-axis depicts $Reward$ as a percentage of $MaximumSupply - Supply$,
the amount of tokens left to be emitted.

Graph variables correspond to those defined above:

- `h` (high) = $MaxConsumptionRate$
- `l` (low) = $MinConsumptionRate$
- `s` = $\frac{Stake}{Supply}$
