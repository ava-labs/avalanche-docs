title: Make Avalanche L1 Permissionless
description: Learn how to transform a Permissioned Avalanche L1 into an Elastic Avalanche L1.
---

Elastic Avalanche L1s are permissionless Avalanche L1s. More information can be found [here](/avalanche-l1s/elastic-avalanche-l1s/parameters).

This how-to guide focuses on taking an already created permissioned Avalanche L1 and transforming it to an elastic (or permissionless) Avalanche L1.

## Prerequisites

- [Avalanche-CLI installed](/tooling/guides/get-avalanche-cli)
- You have deployed a permissioned Avalanche L1 on [local](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/local-network), on [Fuji](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet) or on [Mainnet](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/avalanche-mainnet)

Getting Started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the following commands, make sure to substitute the name of your Avalanche L1 configuration for `<blockchainName>`.

To transform your permissioned Avalanche L1 into an Elastic Avalanche L1 (NOTE: this action is irreversible), run:

```bash
avalanche Avalanche L1 elastic <blockchainName>
```

and, select the network that you want to transform the Avalanche L1 on. Alternatively, you can bypass this prompt by providing the `--local`, `--fuji`, or `--mainnet` flag.

Provide the name and the symbol for the permissionless Avalanche L1's native token. You can also bypass this prompt by providing the `--tokenName` and `--tokenSymbol` flags.

Next, select the Elastic Avalanche L1 config. You can choose to use the default values detailed [here](/avalanche-l1s/elastic-avalanche-l1s/parameters#primary-network-parameters-on-mainnet) or customize the Elastic Avalanche L1 config. To bypass the prompt, you can use `--default` flag to use the default Elastic Avalanche L1 config.

The command may take a couple minutes to run.

### Elastic Avalanche L1 Transformation on Fuji and Mainnet[​](#elastic-avalanche-l1-transformation-on-fuji-and-mainnet "Direct link to heading")

Elastic Avalanche L1 transformation on public network requires private key loaded into the tool, or a connected ledger device.

Both stored key usage and ledger usage are enabled on Fuji (see more on creating keys [here](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet#private-key)) while only ledger usage is enabled on Mainnet (see more on setting up your ledger [here](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/avalanche-mainnet#setting-up-your-ledger)).

To transform a permissioned Avalanche L1 into Elastic Avalanche L1 on public networks, users are required to provide the keys that control the Avalanche L1 defined during the Avalanche L1 deployment process (more info on keys in Fuji can be found [here](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet#deploy-the-avalanche-l1), while more info on ledger signing in Mainnet can be found [here](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/avalanche-mainnet#deploy-the-avalanche-l1)).

### Results[​](#results "Direct link to heading")

If all works as expected, you then have the option to automatically transform all existing permissioned validators to permissionless validators.

You can also to skip automatic transformation at this point and choose to manually add permissionless validators later.

You can use the output details such as the Asset ID and Elastic Avalanche L1 ID to connect to and interact with your Elastic Avalanche L1.

Adding Permissionless Validators to Elastic Avalanche L1[​](#adding-permissionless-validators-to-elastic-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running this command on local network, you will need to first remove permissioned validators (by running `avalanche subnet removeValidator <blockchainName>`) so that you can have a list of local nodes to choose from to be added as a permissionless validator in the Elastic Avalanche L1.

To add permissionless validators to an Elastic Avalanche L1, run:

```bash
avalanche Avalanche L1 join <blockchainName> --elastic
```

You will be prompted with which node you would like to add as a permissionless validator. You can skip this prompt by using `--nodeID` flag.

You will then be prompted with the amount of the Avalanche L1 native token that you like to stake in the validator. Alternatively, you can bypass this prompt by providing the `--stake-amount` flag. Note that choosing to add the maximum validator stake amount (defined during Elastic Avalanche L1 transformation step above) means that you effectively disable delegation in your validator.

Next, select when the validator will start validating and how long it will be validating for. You can also bypass these prompts by using `--start-time` and `--staking-period` flags.

Adding Permissionless Delegator to a Permissionless Validator in Elastic Avalanche L1[​](#adding-permissionless-delegator-to-a-permissionless-validator-in-elastic-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add permissionless delegators, run:

```bash
avalanche Avalanche L1 addPermissionlessDelegator <blockchainName>
```

You will be prompted with which Avalanche L1 validator you would like to delegate to. You can skip this prompt by using `--nodeID` flag.

You will then be prompted with the amount of the Avalanche L1 native token that you like to stake in the validator. Alternatively, you can bypass this prompt by providing the `--stake-amount` flag. The amount that can be delegated to a validator is detailed [here](/avalanche-l1s/elastic-avalanche-l1s/parameters#delegators-weight-checks).

Next, select when you want to start delegating and how long you want to delegate for. You can also bypass these prompts by using `--start-time` and `--staking-period` flags.
