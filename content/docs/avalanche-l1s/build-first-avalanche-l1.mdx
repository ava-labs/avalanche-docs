title: Build Your First Avalanche L1
description: This tutorial walks you through the process of using Avalanche-CLI to create an Avalanche L1, deploy it on a local network, and add to Core wallet.
---

The first step of learning Avalanche L1 development is learning to use [Avalanche-CLI](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli).

Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to install the latest Avalanche-CLI binary is by running the install script:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
```

The binary installs inside the `~/bin` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

You can run all of the commands in this tutorial by calling `~/bin/avalanche`.

You can also add the command to your system path by running:

```bash
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

If you add it to your path, you should be able to call the program anywhere with just `avalanche`. To add it to your path permanently, add an export command to your shell initialization script (ex: .bashrc or .zshrc).

For more detailed installation instructions, see [Avalanche-CLI Installation](/tooling/guides/get-avalanche-cli).

Create Your Avalanche L1 Configuration[​](#create-your-avalanche-l1-configuration "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorials teaches you how to create an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based Avalanche L1. To do so, you use Subnet-EVM, Avalanche's Avalanche L1 fork of the EVM. It supports airdrops, custom fee tokens, configurable gas parameters, and multiple stateful precompiles. To learn more, take a look at [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm). The goal of your first command is to create a Subnet-EVM configuration.

The Avalanche L1 command suite provides a collection of tools for developing and deploying Avalanche L1s.

The Avalanche L1 Creation Wizard walks you through the process of creating your Avalanche L1. To get started, first pick a name for your Avalanche L1. This tutorial uses `myblockchain`, but feel free to substitute that with any name you like. Once you've picked your name, run:

```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain
```

The following sections walk through each question in the wizard.

### Choose Your VM[​](#choose-your-vm "Direct link to heading")

Select `SubnetEVM`.

### Enter Your Avalanche L1's ChainID[​](#enter-your-avalanche-l1s-chainid "Direct link to heading")

Choose a positive integer for your EVM-style ChainID.

In production environments, this ChainID needs to be unique and not shared with any other chain. You can visit [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to verify that your selection is unique. Because this is a development Avalanche L1, feel free to pick any number. Stay away from well-known ChainIDs such as 1 (Ethereum) or 43114 (Avalanche C-Chain) as those may cause issues with other tools.

### Token Symbol[​](#token-symbol "Direct link to heading")

Enter a string to name your Avalanche L1's native token. The token symbol doesn't necessarily need to be unique. Example token symbols are AVAX, JOE, and BTC.

### Subnet-EVM Version[​](#subnet-evm-version "Direct link to heading")

Select `Use latest version`.

### Gas Fee Configuration[​](#gas-fee-configuration "Direct link to heading")

This question determines how to set gas fees on your Avalanche L1.

Select `Low disk use / Low Throughput 1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)`.

### Airdrop[​](#airdrop "Direct link to heading")

Select `Airdrop 1 million tokens to the default address (do not use in production)`.

This address's private key is well-known, so DO NOT send any production funds to it. Attackers would likely drain the funds instantly.

When you are ready to start more mature testing, select `Customize your airdrop` to distribute funds to additional addresses.

### Precompiles[​](#precompiles "Direct link to heading")

Precompiles are Avalanche's way of customizing the behavior of your Avalanche L1. They're strictly an advanced feature, so you can safely select `No` for now.

### Wrapping Up[​](#wrapping-up "Direct link to heading")

If all worked successfully, the command prints `Successfully created blockchain configuration`.

You've successfully created your first Avalanche L1 configuration. Now it's time to deploy it.

Deploying Avalanche L1s Locally[​](#deploying-avalanche-l1s-locally "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy your Avalanche L1, run:

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain
```

Make sure to substitute the name of your Avalanche L1 if you used a different one than `myblockchain`.

Next, select `Local Network`.

This command boots a five node Avalanche network on your machine. It needs to download the latest versions of AvalancheGo and Subnet-EVM. The command may take a couple minutes to run.

Note: If you run `bash` on your shell and are running Avalanche-CLI on ARM64 on Mac, you will require Rosetta 2 to be able to deploy Avalanche L1s locally. You can download Rosetta 2 using `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` .

If all works as expected, the command output should look something like this:

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain

# output

You can use the deployment details to connect to and interact with your Avalanche L1. Now it's time to interact with it.

Interacting with Your Avalanche L1[​](#interacting-with-your-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the value provided by `Browser Extension connection details` to connect to your Avalanche L1 with Core, MetaMask, or any other wallet.

This tutorial uses Core.

### Importing the Test Private Key[​](#importing-the-test-private-key "Direct link to heading")

<Callout type="warn">
This address derives from a well-known private key. Anyone can steal funds sent to this address. Only use it on development networks that only you have access to. If you send production funds to this address, attackers may steal them instantly.
</Callout>

First, you need to import your airdrop private key into Core.

In the Accounts screen, select the `Imported` tab. Click on `Import private key`.

![](/images/deploy-subnet1.png)

Here, enter the private key. Import the well-known private key `0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027`.

![](/images/deploy-subnet2.png)

Next, rename the Core account to prevent confusion. On the `Imported` tab, click on the pen icon next to your account. Rename the account `DO NOT USE -- Public test key` to prevent confusion with any personal wallets.

### Connect to the Avalanche L1[​](#connect-to-the-avalanche-l1 "Direct link to heading")

Next, you need to add your Avalanche L1 to Core's networks.

In the Core Extension click, `See All Networks` and then select the `+` icon in the top right.

![Add network](/images/deploy-subnet5.png)

Enter your Avalanche L1's details, found in the output of your `avalanche blockchain deploy` [command](#deploying-avalanche-l1s-locally), into the form and click `Save`.

![Add network 2](/images/deploy-subnet6.png)

If all worked as expected, your balance should read 1 million tokens. Your Avalanche L1 is ready for action. You might want to try to [Deploy a Smart Contract on Your Subnet-EVM Using Remix and Core](/avalanche-l1s/add-utility/deploy-smart-contract).

Next Steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

After you feel comfortable with this deployment flow, try deploying smart contracts on your chain with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), or [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). You can also experiment with customizing your Avalanche L1 by addingprecompiles or adjusting the airdrop.

Once you've developed a stable Avalanche L1 you like, see [Create an EVM Avalanche L1 on Fuji Testnet](/avalanche-l1s/deploy-a-avalanche-l1/fuji-testnet) to take your Avalanche L1 one step closer to production.

FAQ[​](#faq "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------

**How is the Avalanche L1 ID determined upon creation?**

The Avalanche L1 ID is the hash of the transaction that created the Avalanche L1.
