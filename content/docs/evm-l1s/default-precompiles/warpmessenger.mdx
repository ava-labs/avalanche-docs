The `WarpMessenger` Precompile is used to perform cross chain operations among Avalanche L1s.

Warp Precompile enabled cross-blockchain communication between other Layer 1s and primary-network (C-Chain) by leveraging the Avalanche P-Chain. In order to use Warp messaging, Subnet-EVM chains must activate their Warp precompiles. Warp can be activated with the following lines in upgrade.json:

```json
{
  "warpConfig": {
    "blockTimestamp": (uint),
    "quorumNumerator": (uint)
  }
}
```

`blockTimestamp` must be set to a timestamp after Durango date. `quorumNumerator` is the stake percentage of validators that must sign a Warp message for it to be considered valid. It must be set to a value between 33 and 100. The default value is 67. The `warpConfig` precompile can be later disabled by setting `disable` to `true` in the upgrade.json file.

If you want to use Warp messaging in an existing Subnet-EVM chain, you should coordinate an upgrade with `upgrade.json`. See [Network Upgrades: Enable/Disable Precompiles](#network-upgrades-enabledisable-precompiles) for more information.
