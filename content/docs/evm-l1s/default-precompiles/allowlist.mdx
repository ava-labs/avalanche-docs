title: AllowList Interface
description: The AllowList interface is used by many default precompiles to permission access to the features they provide.

The AllowList is a security feature used by precompiles to manage which addresses have permission to interact with certain contract functionalities. In the case of the Native Minter Precompile, the allow list is used to control who can mint new native tokens.

The AllowList consists of three roles:
- **Admin**: Full control over the allow list, including the ability to add or remove Admins, Managers, and Enabled addresses.
- **Manager**: Can add or remove **Enabled** addresses but cannot modify Admins or Managers.
- **Enabled**: These addresses can use the precompiled contract (e.g., mint native tokens) but cannot modify the allow list.

The allow list provides a granular way to assign permissions, ensuring that only authorized addresses can mint native tokens or manage the minting process.
