The Native Minter Precompile allows you to mint additional native tokens beyond the initial supply on your Avalanche L1 blockchain. 

In order to activate this feature, you will need to provide the `FeeConfigManager` in the genesis:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "nativeMinterConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

By enabling this feature, you can define who has permission to mint new tokens and how minting is managed over time.
