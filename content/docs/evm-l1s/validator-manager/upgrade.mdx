## Convert PoA to PoS

A `PoAValidatorManager` can later be converted to a `PoSValidatorManager` by upgrading the implementation contract pointed to by the proxy. After performing the upgrade, the `PoSValidatorManager` contract should be initialized by calling `initialize` as described above. The validator set contained in the `PoAValidatorManager` will be tracked by the `PoSValidatorManager` after the upgrade, but these validators will neither be eligible to stake and earn staking rewards, nor support delegation.
