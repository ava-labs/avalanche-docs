import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Overview

At a high level, the `ValidatorManager` abstract can be used to manage the validator set on the P-Chain.

<Steps>
<Step>
- Proof of Authority networks are secured by validators who can be added or removed from the `PoAValidatorManager` implementation by an owner address (can be a smart contract).
- Proof of Stake networks are secured by validators who stake some type of tokens for a duration into an implementation of `PoSValidatorManager`.
</Step>
<Step>
Once the transaction confirms, the `ValidatorManager` (which both `PoAValidatorManager` and `PoSValidatorManager` inherit) emits a warp message.
</Step>
<Step>
The warp message is signed off by quorum of the current validator set and submitted to the P-Chain.
</Step>
<Step>
The P-Chain then adds, removes or modifies the validator in the registry using information from the warp message. 
</Step>
</Steps>


## Proof of Authority

There is one implementation of Proof of Authority based on the `ValidatorManager` abstract called `PoAValidatorManager`.

In the `PoAValidatorManager` implementation, the owner of the contract can add and remove validators from the set. The owner can also set the weight of the validator.
The owner can either be a smart contract or an EOA.

### Rewards

By default, no rewards are distributed to validators in the `PoAValidatorManager` implementation. However, rewards can be distributed to validators by extending the `PoAValidatorManager` contract and adding the desired functionality.   

### Parameters

The `PoAValidatorManager` has a couple of parameters that it can be initialized with to fit the needs of the network. These parameters include:
- `ChurnPeriodSeconds`: The time period in seconds that a validator must wait before being removed from the set.
- `MaximumChurnPercentage`: The maximum percentage of the validator set that can be removed in a single churn period.

## Proof of Stake

There are two implmentations offered of Proof of Stake based on the `PoSValidatorManager` abstract:

- `NativeTokenStakingManager`: This contract is used for staking native tokens.
- `ERC20TokenStakingManager`: This contract is used for staking ERC20 tokens.

These are both permissionless implementations, meaning that anyone can stake tokens and become a validator. 

<Callout>
The `PoSValidatorManager` asbtract also comes with a notion of `delegation`. Delegators can delegate their tokens to a validator. This will increase the validator's weight and the delegator will receive a portion of the rewards.
</Callout>

### Rewards

Rewards are calculated using a `RewardCalculator` contract. The `PoSValidatorManager` will distribute rewards to the validator based off their node's liveliness in consensus and after the validator is removed from the set.

In the `NativeTokenStakingManager` implmentation, rewards are minted through use of the `NativeMinter` precompile. Which the address of `NativeTokenStakingManager` is enabled on.

In the `ERC20TokenStakingManager` implementation, rewards are minted through calling the ERC20 token's `mint` function.

### Parameters

The `PoSValidatorManager` has a number of parameters that it can be initialized with to fit the needs of the network. These parameters include:

- `MinimumStakeAmount`: The minimum amount of tokens required to stake.
- `MaximumStakeAmount`: The maximum amount of tokens required to stake.
- `MinimumStakeDuration`: The minimum duration that tokens must be staked for.
- `MinimumDelegationFeeBips`: The minimum fee charged to delegators for delegating their tokens.
- `MaximumStakeMultiplier`: The maximum multiplier that can be applied to a validator's weight.
- `WeightToValueFactor`: The factor used to convert a validator's weight to a value.
- `RewardCalculator`: The address of the reward calculator contract.



## Customization

The `ValidatorManager` abstract contract is designed to be flexible and can be easily extensible to fit the needs of the network.

For example, the `PoSValidatorManager` abstract could be extended to include additional parameters or functionality. This can be done by creating a new contract that inherits from the `PoSValidatorManager` abstract and adding the desired functionality such as NFT staking, slashing, or additional rewards for certain actions.
