### Remove a Validator

Validator exit is initiated with a call to `initializeEndValidation` on the `ValidatorManager`. Only the validator owner may initiate exit. For `PoSValidatorManagers` a `ValidationUptimeMessage` Warp message may optionally be provided in order to calculate the staking rewards; otherwise the latest received uptime will be used (see [(PoS only) Submit an Uptime Proof](#pos-only-submit-an-uptime-proof)). This proof may be requested directly from the L1 validators, which will provide it in a `ValidationUptimeMessage` Warp message. If the uptime is not sufficient to earn validation rewards, the call to `initializeEndValidation` will fail. `forceInitializeEndValidation` acts the same as `initializeEndValidation`, but bypasses the uptime-based rewards check. Once `initializeEndValidation` or `forceInitializeEndValidation` is called, staking rewards cease accruing for `PoSValidatorManagers`.

The `ValidatorManager` constructs an `L1ValidatorWeightMessage` Warp message with the weight set to `0`. This is delivered to the P-Chain as the payload of a `SetL1ValidatorWeightTx`. The P-Chain acknowledges the validator exit by signing an `L1ValidatorRegistrationMessage` with `valid=0`, which is delivered to the `ValidatorManager` by calling `completeEndValidation`. The validation is removed from the contract's state, and for `PoSValidatorManagers`, staking rewards are disbursed and stake is returned.

#### Disable a Validator Directly on the P-Chain

ACP-77 also provides a method to disable a validator without interacting with the L1 directly. The P-Chain transaction `DisableL1ValidatorTx` disables the validator on the P-Chain. The disabled validator's weight will still count towards the L1's total weight.

Disabled L1 validators can re-activate at any time by increasing their balance with an `IncreaseBalanceTx`. Anyone can call `IncreaseBalanceTx` for any validator on the P-Chain. A disabled validator can only be completely and permanently removed from the validator set by a call to `initializeEndValidation`.


### (PoS only) Remove a Delegator

Delegators removal may be initiated by calling `initializeEndDelegation`, as long as churn restrictions are not violated. Similar to `initializeEndValidation`, an uptime proof may be provided to be used to determine delegator rewards eligibility. If no proof is provided, the latest known uptime will be used (see [(PoS only) Submit an Uptime Proof](#pos-only-submit-an-uptime-proof)). The validator's weight is updated on the P-Chain by the same mechanism used to register a delegator. The `L1ValidatorWeightMessage` from the P-Chain is delivered to the `PoSValidatorManager` in the call to `completeEndDelegation`.

Either the delegator owner or the validator owner may initiate removing a delegator. This is to prevent the validator from being unable to remove itself due to churn limitations if it has too high a proportion of the Subnet's total weight due to delegator additions. The validator owner may only remove Delegators after the minimum stake duration has elapsed.


### (PoS only) Collect Staking Rewards

#### Submit an Uptime Proof

The rewards calculator is a function of uptime seconds since the validator's start time. In addition to doing so in the calls to `initializeEndValidation` and `initializeEndDelegation` as described above, uptime proofs may also be supplied by calling `submitUptimeProof`. Unlike `initializeEndValidation` and `initializeEndDelegation`, `submitUptimeProof` may be called by anyone, decreasing the likelihood of a validation or delegation not being able to claim rewards that it deserved based on its actual uptime.

#### Validation Rewards

Validation rewards are distributed in the call to `completeEndValidation`.

#### Delegation Rewards

Delegation rewards are distributed in the call to `completeEndDelegation`.

#### Delegation Fees

Delegation fees owed to validators are _not_ distributed when the validation ends as to bound the amount of gas consumed in the call to `completeEndValidation`. Instead, `claimDelegationFees` may be called after the validation is completed.
