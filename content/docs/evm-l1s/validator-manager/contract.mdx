## Deploying

Three concrete `ValidatorManager` contracts are provided - `PoAValidatorManager`, `NativeTokenStakingManager`, and `ERC20TokenStakingManager`. `NativeTokenStakingManager` and `ERC20TokenStakingManager` implement `PoSValidatorManager`, which itself implements `ValidatorManager`. These are implemented as [upgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol) contracts. There are numerous [guides](https://blog.chain.link/upgradable-smart-contracts/) for deploying upgradeable smart contracts, but the general steps are as follows:

<Steps>
<Step>
Deploy the implementation contract
</Step>
<Step>
Deploy the proxy contract
</Step>
<Step>
Call the implementation contract's `initialize` function

- Each flavor of `ValidatorManager` requires different settings. For example, `ValidatorManagerSettings` specifies the churn parameters, while `PoSValidatorManagerSettings` specifies the staking and rewards parameters.

</Step>
<Step>
Initialize the validator set by calling `initializeValidatorSet`

- When a Subnet is first created on the P-Chain, it must be explicitly converted to an L1 via [`ConvertSubnetToL1Tx`](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets#convertsubnettol1tx). The resulting `SubnetToL1ConversionMessage` Warp [message](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets#subnettol1conversionmessage) is provided in the call to `initializeValidatorSet` to specify the starting validator set in the `ValidatorManager`. Regardless of the implementation, these initial validators are treated as PoA and are not eligible for staking rewards.

</Step>
</Steps>

### PoAValidatorManager

Proof-of-Authority validator management is provided via `PoAValidatorManager`, which restricts modification of the validator set to a specified owner address. After deploying `PoAValidatorManager.sol` and a proxy, the `initialize` function takes the owner address, in addition to standard `ValidatorManagerSettings`.

### PoSValidatorManager

Proof-of-Stake validator management is provided by the abstract contract `PoSValidatorManager`, which has two concrete implementations: `NativeTokenStakingManager` and `ERC20TokenStakingManager`. In addition to basic validator management provided in `ValidatorManager`, `PoSValidatorManager` supports uptime-based validation rewards, as well as delegation to a chosen validator. This [state transition diagram](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/StateTransition.md) illustrates the relationship between validators and delegators.

The `weightToValueFactor` fields of the `PoSValidatorManagerSettings` passed to `PoSValidatorManager`'s `initialize` function sets the factor used to convert between the weight that the validator is registered with on the P-Chain, and the value transferred to the contract as stake. This involves integer division, which may result in loss of precision. When selecting `weightToValueFactor`, it's important to make the following considerations:

1. If `weightToValueFactor` is near the denomination of the asset, then staking amounts on the order of 1 unit of the asset may cause the converted weight to round down to 0. This may impose a larger-than-expected minimum stake amount.
   - Ex: If USDC (denomination of 6) is used as the staking token and `weightToValueFactor` is 1e9, then any amount less than 1,000 USDC will round down to 0 and therefore be invalid.
2. Staked amounts up to `weightToValueFactor - 1` may be lost in the contract as dust, as the validator's registered weight is used to calculate the original staked amount.
   - Ex: `value=1001` and `weightToValueFactor=1e3`. The resulting weight will be `1`. Converting the weight back to a value results in `value=1000`.
3. The validator's weight is represented on the P-Chain as a `uint64`. `PoSValidatorManager` restricts values such that the calculated weight does not exceed the maximum value for that type.
</Callout>
### NativeTokenStakingManager

`NativeTokenStakingManager` allows permissionless addition and removal of validators that post the L1's native token as stake. Staking rewards are minted via the Native Minter Precompile, which is configured with a set of addresses with minting privileges. As such, the address that `NativeTokenStakingManager` is deployed to must be added as an admin to the precompile. This can be done by either calling the precompile's `setAdmin` method from an admin address, or setting the address in the Native Minter precompile settings in the chain's genesis (`config.contractNativeMinterConfig.adminAddresses`). There are a couple of methods to get this address: one is to calculate the resulting deployed address based on the deployer's address and account nonce: `keccak256(rlp.encode(address, nonce))`. The second method involves manually placing the `NativeTokenStakingManager` bytecode at a particular address in the genesis, then setting that address as an admin.

```json
{
    "config" : {
        ...
        "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
            "blockTimestamp": 0,
            "adminAddresses": [
                "0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"
            ]
        }
    },
    "alloc": {
        "0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff": {
            "balance": "0x0",
            "code": "<NativeTokenStakingManagerByteCode>",
            "nonce": 1
        }
    }
}
```

## ERC20TokenStakingManager

`ERC20TokenStakingManager` allows permissionless addition and removal of validators that post an ERC20 token as stake. The ERC20 is specified in the call to `initialize`, and must implement `IERC20Mintable`. Care should be taken to enforce that only authorized users are able to mint the ERC20 staking token.
