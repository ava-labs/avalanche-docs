Precompiles can be used to execute low level Go code through Solidity. 

Subnet-EVM comes with a set of default precompiles that can be used to extend the functionality of the EVM. Such as the Warp Messenger, AllowList, and Reward Manager.
Furthermore, you can create custom precompiles that can be used to extend the functionality of the EVM.
