Reference relayer implementation for cross-chain Avalanche Warp Message delivery.

AWM Relayer listens for Warp message events on a set of source blockchains, and constructs transactions to relay the Warp message to the intended destination blockchain. The relayer does so by querying the source blockchain validator nodes for their BLS signatures on the Warp message, combining the individual BLS signatures into a single aggregate BLS signature, and packaging the aggregate BLS signature into a transaction according to the destination blockchain VM Warp message verification rules.

Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

### Dev Container & Codespace[​](#dev-container--codespace "Direct link to heading")

To get started easily, we provide a Dev Container specification, that can be used using GitHub Codespace or locally using Docker and VS Code. [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are a concept that utilizes containerization to create consistent and isolated development environment. You can run them directly on Github by clicking **Code**, switching to the **Codespaces** tab and clicking **Create codespace on main**. Alternatively, you can run them locally with the extensions for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or other code editors.

### Download Prebuilt Binaries[​](#download-prebuilt-binaries "Direct link to heading")

Prebuilt binaries are available for download from the [releases page](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/releases).

The following commands demonstrate how to download and install the v0.2.13 release of the relayer on MacOS. The exact commands will vary by platform.

```
# Download the release tarball and checksums
curl -w '%{http_code}' -sL -o ~/Downloads/awm-relayer_0.2.13_darwin_arm64.tar.gz https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/releases/download/v0.2.13/awm-relayer_0.2.13_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
curl -w '%{http_code}' -sL -o ~/Downloads/awm-relayer_0.2.13_checksums.txt https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/releases/download/v0.2.13/awm-relayer_0.2.13_checksums.txt

# (Optional) Verify the checksums
cd ~/Downloads
# Confirm that the following two commands output the same checksum
grep "awm-relayer_0.2.13_darwin_arm64.tar.gz" "awm-relayer_0.2.13_checksums.txt" 2>/dev/null
shasum -a 256 "awm-relayer_0.2.13_darwin_arm64.tar.gz" 2>/dev/null

# Extract the tarball and install the relayer binary
tar -xzf awm-relayer_0.2.13_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
sudo install awm-relayer /usr/local/bin
```

_Note:_ If downloading the binaries through a browser on MacOS, the browser may mark the binary as quarantined since it has not been verified through the App Store. To remove the quarantine, run the following command:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/awm-relayer
```

### Download Docker Image[​](#download-docker-image "Direct link to heading")

The published Docker image can be pulled from `avaplatform/awm-relayer:latest` on dockerhub.

### Build from Source[​](#build-from-source "Direct link to heading")

See the [Building](#building) section for instructions on how to build the relayer from source.

Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

### System Requirements[​](#system-requirements "Direct link to heading")

- Ubuntu 22.04 or later
    - Tested on x86\_64/amd64 architecture.
- MacOS 14.3 or later
    - Tested on arm64 architecture (Apple silicon).

### API Requirements[​](#api-requirements "Direct link to heading")

- AWM Relayer requires access to Avalanche API nodes for the P-Chain as well as any connected Subnets. The API nodes must have the following methods enabled:
    - Each Subnet API node must have enabled:
        - eth API (RPC and WS)
    - The P-Chain API node must have enabled:
        - platform.getHeight
        - platform.validatedBy
        - platform.getValidatorsAt OR platform.getCurrentValidators
    - The Info API node must have enabled:
        - info.peers
        - info.getNetworkID
    - If the Info API node is also a Subnet validator, it must have enabled:
        - info.getNodeID
        - info.getNodeIP

The Fuji and Mainnet [public API nodes](/docs/tooling/rpc-providers) provided by Avalanche have these methods enabled, and are suitable for use with the relayer.

### Peer-to-Peer Connections[​](#peer-to-peer-connections "Direct link to heading")

- The AWM relayer implementation gathers BLS signatures from the validators of the source Subnet via peer-to-peer `AppRequest` messages. Validator nodes need to be configured to accept incoming peer connections. Otherwise, the relayer will fail to gather Warp message signatures. For example, networking rules may need to be adjusted to allow traffic on the default AvalancheGo P2P port (9651), or the public IP may need to be manually set in the [node configuration](/docs/nodes/configure/configs-flags#public-ip).

Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------

### Building[​](#building "Direct link to heading")

Before building, be sure to install Go, which is required even if you're just building the Docker image.

Build the relayer by running the script:

Build a Docker image by running the script:

```
./scripts/build_local_image.sh
```

### Running[​](#running "Direct link to heading")

The relayer binary accepts a path to a JSON configuration file as the sole argument. Command line configuration arguments are not currently supported.

```
./build/awm-relayer --config-file path-to-config
```

### Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to heading")

The relayer is configured via a JSON file, the path to which is passed in via the `--config-file` command line argument. Top level configuration options are also able to be set via environment variable. To get the environment variable corresponding to a key, upper case the key and change the delimiter from "-" to "\_". For example, `LOG_LEVEL` sets the `"log-level"` JSON key. The following configuration options are available:

`"log-level": "verbo" | "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "fatal" | "panic"`

- The log level for the relayer. Defaults to `info`.

`"p-chain-api": APIConfig`

        - info.peers
        - info.getNetworkID
    - Additionally, if the Info API node is also a validator, it must have enabled:
        
        - info.getNodeID
        - info.getNodeIP
    
    `"query-parameters": map[string]string`
    
    - Additional query parameters to include in the API requests.

`"storage-location": string`

- The path to the directory in which the relayer will store its state. Defaults to `./awm-relayer-storage`.

`"redis-url": string`

- The URL of the Redis server to use to manage state. This URL should specify the user, password, host, port, DB index, and protocol version. For example, `"redis://user:password@localhost:6379/0?protocol=3"`. Overrides `storage-location` if provided.

`"process-missed-blocks": boolean`

- Whether or not to process missed blocks after restarting. Defaults to `true`. If set to false, the relayer will start processing blocks from the chain head.

`"manual-warp-messages": []ManualWarpMessage`

    `"supported-destinations": []SupportedDestination`
    
    - List of destinations that the source blockchain supports. Each `SupportedDestination` consists of a cb58-encoded destination blockchain ID (`"blockchain-id"`), and a list of hex-encoded addresses (`"addresses"`) on that destination blockchain that the relayer supports delivering Warp messages to. The destination address is defined by the message protocol. For example, it could be the address called from the message protocol contract. If no supported addresses are provided, all addresses are allowed on that blockchain. If `supported-destinations` is empty, then all destination blockchains (and therefore all addresses on those destination blockchains) are supported.
    
    `"process-historical-blocks-from-height": unsigned integer`

    `"kms-key-id": string`
    
    - The ID of the KMS key to use for signing transactions on the destination blockchain. Only one of `account-private-key` or `kms-key-id` should be provided. If `kms-key-id` is provided, then `kms-aws-region` is required.
    
    `"kms-aws-region": string`
    
    - The AWS region in which the KMS key is located. Required if `kms-key-id` is provided.

Architecture[​](#architecture "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------

### Components[​](#components "Direct link to heading")

The relayer consists of the following components:

- At the global level:
    - P2P app network: issues signature `AppRequests`
    - P-Chain client: gets the validators for a Subnet
    - JSON database: stores latest processed block for each Application Relayer
- Per Source Blockchain
    - Subscriber: listens for logs pertaining to cross-chain message transactions
    - Source RPC client: queries for missed blocks on startup
- Per Destination Blockchain
    - Destination RPC client: broadcasts transactions to the destination
- Application Relayers
    - Relay messages from a specific source blockchain and source address to a specific destination blockchain and destination address

### Data Flow[​](#data-flow "Direct link to heading")

![](/images/run-relayer1.png)

Testing[​](#testing "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------

### Unit Tests[​](#unit-tests "Direct link to heading")

Unit tests can be ran locally by running the command in the root of the project:

If your temporary directory is not writable, the unit tests may fail with messages like `fork/exec /tmp/go-build2296620589/b247/config.test: permission denied`. To fix this, set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to something writable, for example `export TMPDIR=~/tmp`.

### E2E Tests[​](#e2e-tests "Direct link to heading")

E2E tests are ran as part of CI, but can also be ran locally with the `--local` flag. To run the E2E tests locally, you'll need to install Gingko following the instructions [here](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#installing-ginkgo)

Next, provide the path to the `subnet-evm` repository and the path to a writeable data directory (this example uses `~/subnet-evm` and `~/tmp/e2e-test`) to use for the tests:

```
./scripts/e2e_test.sh --local --subnet-evm ~/subnet-evm --data-dir ~/tmp/e2e-test
```

To run a specific E2E test, specify the environment variable `GINKGO_FOCUS`, which will then look for [test descriptions](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/blob/main/tests/e2e_test.go#L68) that match the provided input. For example, to run the `Basic Relay` test:

```
GINKGO_FOCUS="Basic" ./scripts/e2e_test.sh --local --subnet-evm ~/subnet-evm --data-dir ~/tmp/e2e-test
```

The E2E tests use the `TeleporterMessenger` contract deployment transaction specified in the following files:

- `tests/utils/UniversalTeleporterDeployerAddress.txt`
- `tests/utils/UniversalTeleporterDeployerTransaction.txt`
- `tests/utils/UniversalTeleporterMessagerContractAddress.txt` To update the version of Teleporter used by the E2E tests, update these values with the latest contract deployment information. For more information on how to deploy the Teleporter contract, see the [Teleporter documentation](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/tree/main/utils/contract-deployment).

### Generate Mocks[​](#generate-mocks "Direct link to heading")

[Gomock](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/mock/gomock) is used to generate mocks for testing. To generate mocks, run the following command at the root of the project:
