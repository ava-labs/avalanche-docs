title: System Requirements
description: This document provides information about the system and networking requirements for running an AvalancheGo node.
---

## Hardware and Operating Systems

Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity hardware. Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may change.

- **CPU**: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- **RAM**: 8 GiB (16 GiB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1 TiB SSD
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
Nodes which choose to use a HDD may get poor and random read/write latencies, therefore reducing performance and reliability. An SSD is strongly suggested.

## Networking

To run successfully, AvalancheGo needs to accept connections from the Internet on the network port `9651`. Before you proceed with the installation, you need to determine the networking environment your node will run in.

### On a Cloud Provider

If your node is running on a cloud provider computer instance, it will have a static IP. Find out what that static IP is, or set it up if you didn't already.

### On a Home Connection

If you're running a node on a computer that is on a residential internet connection, you have a dynamic IP; that is, your IP will change periodically. **For the sake of demonstration, you can ignore the following information.** Otherwise, you will need to set up inbound port forwarding of port `9651` from the internet to the computer the node is installed on.

As there are too many models and router configurations, we cannot provide instructions on what exactly to do, but there are online guides to be found (like [this](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/), or [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/) ), and your service provider support might help too.

<Callout title="Note">
Please note that a fully connected Avalanche node maintains and communicates over a couple of thousand of live TCP connections.

For some under-powered and older home routers, that might be too much to handle. If that is the case, you may experience lagging on other computers connected to the same router, node getting benched, or failing to sync and similar issues.
