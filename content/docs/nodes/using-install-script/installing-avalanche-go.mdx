## Running the Script

So, now that you prepared your system and have the info ready, let's get to it.

To download and run the script, enter the following in the terminal:

```bash
wget -nd -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs/master/scripts/avalanchego-installer.sh;\
chmod 755 avalanchego-installer.sh;\
./avalanchego-installer.sh
```

And we're off! The output should look something like this:

And then the script will prompt you for information about the network environment:

```bash
To complete the setup some networking information is needed.
Where is the node installed:
1) residential network (dynamic IP)
2) cloud provider (static IP)
Enter your connection type [1,2]:
```

Enter `1` if you have dynamic IP, and `2` if you have a static IP. If you are on a static IP, it will try to auto-detect the IP and ask for confirmation.

```bash
Detected '3.15.152.14' as your public IP. Is this correct? [y,n]:
```

Confirm with `y`, or `n` if the detected IP is wrong (or empty), and then enter the correct IP at the next prompt.

Next, you have to set up RPC port access for your node. Those are used to query the node for its internal state, to send commands to the node, or to interact with the platform and its chains (sending transactions, for example). You will be prompted:

```bash
RPC port should be public (this is a public API node) or private (this is a validator)? [public, private]:
```

- `private`: this setting only allows RPC requests from the node machine itself.
- `public`: this setting exposes the RPC port to all network interfaces.

As this is a sensitive setting you will be asked to confirm if choosing `public`. Please read the following note carefully:

<Callout title="Note">
If you choose to allow RPC requests on any network interface you will need to set up a firewall to only let through RPC requests from known IP addresses, otherwise your node will be accessible to anyone and might be overwhelmed by RPC calls from malicious actors! If you do not plan to use your node to send RPC calls remotely, enter `private`.
</Callout>

The script will then prompt you to choose whether to enable state sync setting or not:

```bash
Do you want state sync bootstrapping to be turned on or off? [on, off]:
```

Turning state sync on will greatly increase the speed of bootstrapping, but will sync only the current network state. If you intend to use your node for accessing historical data (archival node) you should select `off`. Otherwise, select `on`. Validators can be bootstrapped with state sync turned on.

The script will then continue with system service creation and finish with starting the service.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Click to see the final output">
```bash
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/avalanchego.service → /etc/systemd/system/avalanchego.service.

Done!

Your node should now be bootstrapping.
Node configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
C-Chain configuration file is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/configs/chains/C/config.json
Plugin directory, for storing subnet VM binaries, is /home/ubuntu/.avalanchego/plugins
To check that the service is running use the following command (q to exit):
sudo systemctl status avalanchego
To follow the log use (ctrl-c to stop):
sudo journalctl -u avalanchego -f

Reach us over on https://chat.avax.network if you're having problems.

The script is finished, and you should see the system prompt again.

## Post Installation

AvalancheGo should be running in the background as a service. You can check that it's running with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status avalanchego
```

Below is an example of what the node's latest logs should look like:

Note the `active (running)` which indicates the service is running OK. You may need to press `q` to return to the command prompt.

To find out your NodeID, which is used to identify your node to the network, run the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u avalanchego | grep "NodeID"
```

It will produce output like:

```bash
Jan 05 10:38:38 ip-172-31-30-64 avalanchego[2142]: INFO [01-05|10:38:38] avalanchego/node/node.go#428: Set node's ID to 6seStrauyCnVV7NEVwRbfaT9B6EnXEzfY
```

Prepend `NodeID-` to the value to get, for example, `NodeID-6seStrauyCnVV7NEVwRbfaT9B6EnXEzfY`. Store that; it will be needed for staking or looking up your node.

Your node should be in the process of bootstrapping now. You can monitor the progress by issuing the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u avalanchego -f
```

Press `ctrl+C` when you wish to stop reading node output.
