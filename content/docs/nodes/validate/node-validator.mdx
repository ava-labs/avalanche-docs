title: Turn Node Into Validator
description: This tutorial will show you how to add a node to the validator set of Primary Network on Avalanche.
---

## Introduction

The [Primary Network](/docs/learn/primary-network)
is inherent to the Avalanche platform and validates Avalanche's built-in
blockchains. In this
tutorial, we'll add a node to the Primary Network on Avalanche.

The P-Chain manages metadata on Avalanche. This includes tracking which nodes
are in which Subnets, which blockchains exist, and which Subnets are validating
which blockchains. To add a validator, we'll issue
[transactions](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587384-what-is-a-transaction)
to the P-Chain.

<Callout type="warn">
Note that once you issue the transaction to add a node as a validator, there is
no way to change the parameters. **You can't remove your stake early or change
the stake amount, node ID, or reward address.** Please make sure you're using
the correct values in the API calls below. If you're not sure, feel free to join
our [Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org/) to ask questions.
</Callout>

## Requirements

You've completed [Run an Avalanche Node](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/manually) and are familiar with
[Avalanche's architecture](/docs/learn/primary-network). In this
tutorial, we use [AvalancheJS](/docs/tooling/avalanche-js) and
[Avalanche's Postman collection](/docs/tooling/avalanchego-postman-collection/setup.md) 
to help us make API calls.

In order to ensure your node is well-connected, make sure that your node can
receive and send TCP traffic on the staking port (`9651` by default) and your node
has a public IP address(it's optional to set --public-ip=[YOUR NODE'S PUBLIC IP HERE]
when executing the AvalancheGo binary, as by default, the node will attempt to perform
NAT traversal to get the node's IP according to its router). Failing to do either of
these may jeopardize your staking reward.

## Add a Validator with Core extension

First, we show you how to add your node as a validator by using [Core web](https://core.app).

### Retrieve the Node ID, the BLS signature and the BLS key

Get this info by calling [`info.getNodeID`](/docs/api-reference/info-api.md#infogetnodeid):

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

The response has your node's ID, the BLS key (public key) and the BLS signature (proof of possession):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "nodeID": "NodeID-5mb46qkSBj81k9g9e4VFjGGSbaaSLFRzD",
    "nodePOP": {
      "publicKey": "0x8f95423f7142d00a48e1014a3de8d28907d420dc33b3052a6dee03a3f2941a393c2351e354704ca66a3fc29870282e15",
      "proofOfPossession": "0x86a3ab4c45cfe31cae34c1d06f212434ac71b1be6cfe046c80c162e057614a94a5bc9f1ded1a7029deb0ba4ca7c9b71411e293438691be79c2dbf19d1ca7c3eadb9c756246fc5de5b7b89511c7d7302ae051d9e03d7991138299b5ed6a570a98"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Add as a Validator

Connect [Core extension](https://join.core.app/extension) to [Core web](https://core.app), and go the 'Staking' tab. 
Here, choose 'Validate' from the menu.

Fill out the staking parameters. They are explained in more detail in [this doc](/docs/nodes/validate/how-to-stake.md). When you've 
filled in all the staking parameters and double-checked them, click `Submit Validation`. Make sure the staking period is at
least 2 weeks, the delegation fee rate is at least 2%, and you're staking at
least 2,000 AVAX on Mainnet (1 AVAX on Fuji Testnet). A full guide about this can be found 
[here](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/8117267-core-web-how-do-i-validate-in-core-stake).

You should see a success message, and your balance should be updated.

Go back to the `Stake` tab, and you'll see here an overview of your validation,
with information like the amount staked, staking time, and more.

![Staking Overview](/images/staking-overview.png)

Calling
[`platform.getPendingValidators`](/docs/api-reference/p-chain/api.md#platformgetpendingvalidators)
verifies that your transaction was accepted. Note that this API call should be
made before your node's validation start time, otherwise, the return will not
include your node's id as it is no longer pending.

You can also call
[`platform.getCurrentValidators`](/docs/api-reference/p-chain/api.md#platformgetcurrentvalidators)
to check that your node's id is included in the response.

That's it!

## Add a Validator with AvalancheJS

We can also add a node to the validator set using [AvalancheJS](/docs/tooling/avalanche-js).

### Install AvalancheJS

To use AvalancheJS, you can clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchejs.git
```

<Callout title="Note">
The repository cloning method used is HTTPS, but SSH can be used too:

`git clone git@github.com:ava-labs/avalanchejs.git`

You can find more about SSH and how to use it
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).
</Callout>

or add it to an existing project:

```bash
yarn add @avalabs/avalanchejs
```

For this tutorial we will use [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node)
to run the example scripts directly from an AvalancheJS directory.

### Fuji Workflow

In this section, we will use Fuji Testnet to show how to add a node to the validator set.

Open your AvalancheJS directory and select the
[**`examples/p-chain`**](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchejs/tree/master/examples/p-chain)
folder to view the source code for the examples scripts.

We will use the
[**`validate.ts`**](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchejs/blob/master/examples/p-chain/validate.ts)
script to add a validator.

#### Add Necessary Environment Variables

Locate the `.env.example` file at the root of AvalancheJS, and remove `.example`
from the title. Now, this will be the `.env` file for global variables.

Add the private key and the P-Chain address associated with it.
The API URL is already set to Fuji (`https://api.avax-test.network/`).

![env Variables](/images/validator-avalanchejs-1.png)

#### Retrieve the Node ID, the BLS signature and the BLS key

Get this info by calling [`info.getNodeID`](/docs/api-reference/info-api.md#infogetnodeid):

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
}' -H 'content-type:application/json' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

The response has your node's ID, the BLS key (public key) and the BLS signature (proof of possession):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "nodeID": "NodeID-JXJNyJXhgXzvVGisLkrDiZvF938zJxnT5",
    "nodePOP": {
      "publicKey": "0xb982b485916c1d74e3b749e7ce49730ac0e52d28279ce4c5c989d75a43256d3012e04b1de0561276631ea6c2c8dc4429",
      "proofOfPossession": "0xb6cdf3927783dba3245565bd9451b0c2a39af2087fdf401956489b42461452ec7639b9082195b7181907177b1ea09a6200a0d32ebbc668d9c1e9156872633cfb7e161fbd0e75943034d28b25ec9d9cdf2edad4aaf010adf804af8f6d0d5440c5"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

#### Fill in the Node ID, the BLS signature and the BLS key

After retrieving this data, go to `examples/p-chain/validate.ts`.

Replace the `nodeID`, `blsPublicKey` and `blsSignature` with your 
own node's values.

![Replaced values](/images/validator-avalanchejs-2.png)

#### Settings for Validation

Next we need to specify the node's validation period and delegation fee.

#### Validation Period

The validation period is set by default to 21 days, the start date
being the date and time the transaction is issued. The start date
cannot be modified.

The end date can be adjusted in the code.

Let's say we want the validation period to end after 50 days.
You can achieve this by adding the number of desired days to
`endTime.getDate()`, in this case `50`.

```ts
// move ending date 50 days into the future
endTime.setDate(endTime.getDate() + 50);
```

Now let's say you want the staking period to end on a specific 
date and time, for example May 15, 2024, at 11:20 AM.
It can be achieved as shown in the code below.

```ts
const startTime = await new PVMApi().getTimestamp();
const startDate = new Date(startTime.timestamp);
const start = BigInt(startDate.getTime() / 1000);

// Set the end time to a specific date and time
const endTime = new Date('2024-05-15T11:20:00'); // May 15, 2024, at 11:20 AM
const end = BigInt(endTime.getTime() / 1000);
```

#### Delegation Fee Rate

Avalanche allows for delegation of stake. This parameter is the percent fee this
validator charges when others delegate stake to them. For example, if
`delegationFeeRate` is `10` and someone delegates to this validator, then when
the delegation period is over, 10% of the reward goes to the validator and the
rest goes to the delegator, if this node meets the validation reward
requirements.

The delegation fee on AvalancheJS is set `20`. To change this, you need
to provide the desired fee percent as a parameter to `newAddPermissionlessValidatorTx`,
which is by default `1e4 * 20`.

For example, if you'd want it to be `10`, the updated code would look like this:

```ts
const tx = newAddPermissionlessValidatorTx(
  context,
  utxos,
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  nodeID,
  PrimaryNetworkID.toString(),
  start,
  end,
  BigInt(1e9),
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  1e4 * 10, // delegation fee, replaced 20 with 10
  undefined,
  1,
  0n,
  blsPublicKey,
  blsSignature,
);
```

#### Stake Amount

Set the amount being locked for validation when calling
`newAddPermissionlessValidatorTx` by replacing `weight` with a number
in the unit of nAVAX. For example, `2 AVAX` would be `2e9 nAVAX`.

```ts
const tx = newAddPermissionlessValidatorTx(
  context,
  utxos,
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  nodeID,
  PrimaryNetworkID.toString(),
  start,
  end,
  BigInt(2e9), // the amount to stake
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  [bech32ToBytes(P_CHAIN_ADDRESS)],
  1e4 * 10,
  undefined,
  1,
  0n,
  blsPublicKey,
  blsSignature,
);
```

#### Execute the Code

Now that we have made all of the necessary changes to the example script, it's
time to add a validator to the Fuji Network.

Run the command:

```bash
node --loader ts-node/esm examples/p-chain/validate.ts
```

The response:

```bash
laviniatalpas@Lavinias-MacBook-Pro avalanchejs % node --loader ts-node/esm examples/p-chain/validate.ts
(node:87616) ExperimentalWarning: `--experimental-loader` may be removed in the future; instead use `register()`:
--import 'data:text/javascript,import { register } from "node:module"; import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url"; register("ts-node/esm", pathToFileURL("./"));'
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
{ txID: 'RVe3CFRieRbBvKXKPu24Zbt1QehdyGVT6X4tPWVBeACPX3Ab8' }
```

We can check the transaction's status by running the example script with
[`platform.getTxStatus`](/docs/api-reference/p-chain/api#platformgettxstatus)
or looking up the validator directly on the 
[explorer](https://subnets-test.avax.network/validators/NodeID-JXJNyJXhgXzvVGisLkrDiZvF938zJxnT5).

### Mainnet Workflow

The Fuji workflow above can be adapted to Mainnet with the following modifications:

- `AVAX_PUBLIC_URL` should be `https://api.avax.network/`.
- `P_CHAIN_ADDRESS` should be the Mainnet P-Chain address.
- Set the correct amount to stake.
- The `blsPublicKey`, `blsSignature` and `nodeID` need to be the ones for your Mainnet Node.
