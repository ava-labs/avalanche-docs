Staking Parameters on Avalanche[​](#staking-parameters-on-avalanche "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a validator is done validating the [Primary Network](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4135650-what-is-the-primary-network), it receives back the AVAX tokens it staked. It may receive a reward for helping to secure the network. A validator only receives a [validation reward](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587396-what-are-validator-staking-rewards) if it is sufficiently responsive and correct during the time it validates. Read the [Avalanche token white paper](https://www.avalabs.org/whitepapers) to learn more about AVAX and the mechanics of staking.

<Callout type="warn">
Staking rewards are sent to your wallet address at the end of the staking term **as long as all of these parameters are met**.
</Callout>

### Mainnet[​](#mainnet "Direct link to heading")

- The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX
- The minimum amount that a delegator must delegate is 25 AVAX
- The minimum amount of time one can stake funds for validation is 2 weeks
- The maximum amount of time one can stake funds for validation is 1 year
- The minimum amount of time one can stake funds for delegation is 2 weeks
- The maximum amount of time one can stake funds for delegation is 1 year
- The minimum delegation fee rate is 2%
- The maximum weight of a validator (their own stake + stake delegated to them) is the minimum of 3 million AVAX and 5 times the amount the validator staked. For example, if you staked 2,000 AVAX to become a validator, only 8000 AVAX can be delegated to your node total (not per delegator)

A validator will receive a staking reward if they are online and response for more than 80% of their validation period, as measured by a majority of validators, weighted by stake. **You should aim for your validator be online and responsive 100% of the time.**

You can call API method `info.uptime` on your node to learn its weighted uptime and what percentage of the network currently thinks your node has an uptime high enough to receive a staking reward. See [here.](/docs/api-reference/info-api#infouptime) You can get another opinion on your node's uptime from Avalanche's [Validator Health dashboard](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/validator-health-check/). If your reported uptime is not close to 100%, there may be something wrong with your node setup, which may jeopardize your staking reward. If this is the case, please see [here](#why-is-my-uptime-low) or contact us on [Discord](https://chat.avax.network/) so we can help you find the issue. Note that only checking the uptime of your validator as measured by non-staking nodes, validators with small stake, or validators that have not been online for the full duration of your validation period can provide an inaccurate view of your node's true uptime.

### Fuji Testnet[​](#fuji-testnet "Direct link to heading")

On Fuji Testnet, all staking parameters are the same as those on Mainnet except the following ones:

- The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 1 AVAX
- The minimum amount that a delegator must delegate is 1 AVAX
- The minimum amount of time one can stake funds for validation is 24 hours
- The minimum amount of time one can stake funds for delegation is 24 hours

Validators[​](#validators "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

**Validators** secure Avalanche, create new blocks, and process transactions. To achieve consensus, validators repeatedly sample each other. The probability that a given validator is sampled is proportional to its stake.

When you add a node to the validator set, you specify:

- Your node's ID
- Your node's BLS key and BLS signature
- When you want to start and stop validating
- How many AVAX you are staking
- The address to send any rewards to
- Your delegation fee rate (see below)

<Callout title="Note">
The minimum amount that a validator must stake is 2,000 AVAX.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
Note that once you issue the transaction to add a node as a validator, there is no way to change the parameters. **You can't remove your stake early or change the stake amount, node ID, or reward address.**

Please make sure you're using the correct values in the API calls below. If you're not sure, ask for help on [Discord](https://chat.avax.network/). If you want to add more tokens to your own validator, you can delegate the tokens to this node - but you cannot increase the base validation amount (so delegating to yourself goes against your delegation cap).
</Callout>

### Running a Validator[​](#running-a-validator "Direct link to heading")

If you're running a validator, it's important that your node is well connected to ensure that you receive a reward.

When you issue the transaction to add a validator, the staked tokens and transaction fee (which is 0) are deducted from the addresses you control. When you are done validating, the staked funds are returned to the addresses they came from. If you earned a reward, it is sent to the address you specified when you added yourself as a validator.

#### Allow API Calls[​](#allow-api-calls "Direct link to heading")

To make API calls to your node from remote machines, allow traffic on the API port (`9650` by default), and run your node with argument `--http-host=`

You should disable all APIs you will not use via command-line arguments. You should configure your network to only allow access to the API port from trusted machines (for example, your personal computer.)

#### Why Is My Uptime Low?[​](#why-is-my-uptime-low "Direct link to heading")

Every validator on Avalanche keeps track of the uptime of other validators. Every validator has a weight (that is the amount staked on it.) The more weight a validator has, the more influence they have when validators vote on whether your node should receive a staking reward. You can call API method `info.uptime` on your node to learn its weighted uptime and what percentage of the network stake currently thinks your node has an uptime high enough to receive a staking reward.

You can also see the connections a node has by calling `info.peers`, as well as the uptime of each connection. **This is only one node's point of view**. Other nodes may perceive the uptime of your node differently. Just because one node perceives your uptime as being low does not mean that you will not receive staking rewards.

If your node's uptime is low, make sure you're setting config option `--public-ip=[NODE'S PUBLIC IP]` and that your node can receive incoming TCP traffic on port 9651.

#### Secret Management[​](#secret-management "Direct link to heading")

The only secret that you need on your validating node is its Staking Key, the TLS key that determines your node's ID. The first time you start a node, the Staking Key is created and put in `$HOME/.avalanchego/staking/staker.key`. You should back up this file (and `staker.crt`) somewhere secure. Losing your Staking Key could jeopardize your validation reward, as your node will have a new ID.

You do not need to have AVAX funds on your validating node. In fact, it's best practice to **not** have a lot of funds on your node. Almost all of your funds should be in "cold" addresses whose private key is not on any computer.

#### Monitoring[​](#monitoring "Direct link to heading")

Follow this [tutorial](/docs/nodes/maintain/monitoring) to learn how to monitor your node's uptime, general health, etc.

### Reward Formula[​](#reward-formula "Direct link to heading")

Consider a validator which stakes a $Stake$ amount of Avax for $StakingPeriod$ seconds.

Assume that at the start of the staking period there is a $Supply$ amount of Avax in the Primary Network.

The maximum amount of Avax is $MaximumSupply$ . Then at the end of its staking period, a responsive validator receives a reward calculated as follows:

$$
Reward = \left(MaximumSupply - Supply \right) \times \frac{Stake}{Supply} \times \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period} \times EffectiveConsumptionRate
$$

where,

$$
EffectiveConsumptionRate = 
$$

$$
\frac{MinConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator} \times \left(1- \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period}\right) + \frac{MaxConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator} \times \frac{Staking Period}{Minting Period}
$$

<Callout title="Note">
Note that $StakingPeriod$ is the staker's entire staking period, not just the staker's uptime, that is the aggregated time during which the staker has been responsive. The uptime comes into play only to decide whether a staker should be rewarded; to calculate the actual reward, only the staking period duration is taken into account.
</Callout>

$EffectiveConsumptionRate$ is a linear combination of $MinConsumptionRate$ and $MaxConsumptionRate$.
$MinConsumptionRate$ and $MaxConsumptionRate$ bound $EffectiveConsumptionRate$ because 

$$
MinConsumptionRate \leq EffectiveConsumptionRate \leq MaxConsumptionRate
$$

The larger $StakingPeriod$ is, the closer $EffectiveConsumptionRate$ is to $MaxConsumptionRate$.

A staker achieves the maximum reward for its stake if $StakingPeriod$ = $Minting Period$.

The reward is:

$$
Max Reward = \left(MaximumSupply - Supply \right) \times \frac{Stake}{Supply} \times \frac{MaxConsumptionRate}{PercentDenominator}
$$

Delegators[​](#delegators "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

A delegator is a token holder, who wants to participate in staking, but chooses to trust an existing validating node through delegation.

When you delegate stake to a validator, you specify:

- The ID of the node you're delegating to
- When you want to start/stop delegating stake (must be while the validator is validating)
- How many AVAX you are staking
- The address to send any rewards to

<Callout title="Note">
The minimum amount that a delegator must delegate is 25 AVAX.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
Note that once you issue the transaction to add your stake to a delegator, there is no way to change the parameters. **You can't remove your stake early or change the stake amount, node ID, or reward address.** If you're not sure, ask for help on [Discord](https://chat.avax.network/).
</Callout>

### Delegator Rewards[​](#delegator-rewards "Direct link to heading")

If the validator that you delegate tokens to is sufficiently correct and responsive, you will receive a reward when you are done delegating. Delegators are rewarded according to the same function as validators. However, the validator that you delegate to keeps a portion of your reward specified by the validator's delegation fee rate.

When you issue the transaction to delegate tokens, the staked tokens and transaction fee are deducted from the addresses you control. When you are done delegating, the staked tokens are returned to your address. If you earned a reward, it is sent to the address you specified when you delegated tokens. Rewards are sent to delegators right after the delegation ends with the return of staked tokens, and before the validation period of the node they're delegating to is complete.

FAQ[​](#faq "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------

### Is There a Tool to Check the Health of a Validator?[​](#is-there-a-tool-to-check-the-health-of-a-validator "Direct link to heading")

Yes, just enter your node's ID in the Avalanche Stats [Validator Health Dashboard](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/validator-health-check/?nodeid=NodeID-Jp4dLMTHd6huttS1jZhqNnBN9ZMNmTmWC).

### How Is It Determined Whether a Validator Receives a Staking Reward?[​](#how-is-it-determined-whether-a-validator-receives-a-staking-reward "Direct link to heading")

When a node leaves the validator set, the validators vote on whether the leaving node should receive a staking reward or not. If a validator calculates that the leaving node was responsive for more than the required uptime (currently 80%), the validator will vote for the leaving node to receive a staking reward. Otherwise, the validator will vote that the leaving node should not receive a staking reward. The result of this vote, which is weighted by stake, determines whether the leaving node receives a reward or not.

Each validator only votes "yes" or "no." It does not share its data such as the leaving node's uptime.

Each validation period is considered separately. That is, suppose a node joins the validator set, and then leaves. Then it joins and leaves again. The node's uptime during its first period in the validator set does not affect the uptime calculation in the second period, hence, has no impact on whether the node receives a staking reward for its second period in the validator set.

### How Are Delegation Fees Distributed To Validators?[​](#how-are-delegation-fees-distributed-to-validators "Direct link to heading")

If a validator is online for 80% of a delegation period, they receive a % of the reward (the fee) earned by the delegator. The P-Chain used to distribute this fee as a separate UTXO per delegation period. After the [Cortina Activation](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/cortina-x-chain-linearization-a1d9305553f6), instead of sending a fee UTXO for each successful delegation period, fees are now batched during a node's entire validation period and are distributed when it is unstaked.

### Error: Couldn't Issue TX: Validator Would Be Over Delegated[​](#error-couldnt-issue-tx-validator-would-be-over-delegated "Direct link to heading")

This error occurs whenever the delegator can not delegate to the named validator. This can be caused by the following.

- The delegator `startTime` is before the validator `startTime`
- The delegator `endTime` is after the validator `endTime`
- The delegator weight would result in the validator total weight exceeding its maximum weight
