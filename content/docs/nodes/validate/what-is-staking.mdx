Staking is the process where users lock up their tokens to support a blockchain network and, in return, receive rewards. It is an essential part of proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms used by many blockchain networks, including Avalanche. PoS systems require participants to stake a certain amount of tokens as collateral to participate in the network and validate transactions.

To resist [sybil attacks](https://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4064853-what-is-a-sybil-attack), a decentralized network must require that network influence is paid with a scarce resource. This makes it infeasibly expensive for an attacker to gain enough influence over the network to compromise its security. On Avalanche, the scarce resource is the native token, [AVAX](/learn/avax-token). For a node to validate a blockchain on Avalanche, it must stake AVAX.
