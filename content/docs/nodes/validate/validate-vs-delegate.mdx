Validation[​](#validation "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

Validation in the context of staking refers to the act of running a node on the blockchain network to validate transactions and secure the network.

- **Stake Requirement**: To become a validator on the Avalanche network, one must stake a minimum amount of 2,000 AVAX tokens on the Mainnet (1 AVAX on the Fuji Testnet).
- **Process**: Validators participate in achieving consensus by repeatedly sampling other validators. The probability of being sampled is proportional to the validator's stake, meaning the more tokens a validator stakes, the more influential they are in the consensus process.
- **Rewards**: Validators are eligible to receive rewards for their efforts in securing the network. To receive rewards, a validator must be online and responsive for more than 80% of their validation period.

Delegation[​](#delegation "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

Delegation allows token holders who do not wish to run their own validator node to still participate in staking by "delegating" their tokens to an existing validator node.

- **Stake Requirement**: To delegate on the Avalanche network, a minimum of 25 AVAX tokens is required on the Mainnet (1 AVAX on the Fuji Testnet).
- **Process**: Delegators choose a specific validator node to delegate their tokens to, trusting that the validator will behave correctly and help secure the network on their behalf.
- **Rewards**: Delegators are also eligible to receive rewards for their stake. The validator they delegate to shares a portion of the reward with them, according to the validator's delegation fee rate.

Key Differences[​](#key-differences "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------

- **Responsibilities**: Validators actively run a node, validate transactions, and actively participate in securing the network. Delegators, on the other hand, do not run a node themselves but entrust their tokens to a validator to participate on their behalf.
- **Stake Requirement**: Validators have a higher minimum stake requirement compared to delegators, as they take on more responsibility in the network.
- **Rewards Distribution**: Validators receive rewards directly for their validation efforts. Delegators receive rewards indirectly through the validator they delegate to, sharing a portion of the validator's reward.

In summary, validation involves actively participating in securing the network by running a node, while delegation allows token holders to participate passively by trusting their stake to a chosen validator. Both validators and delegators can earn rewards, but validators have higher stakes and more direct involvement in the Avalanche network.
