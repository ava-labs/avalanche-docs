If you experience any issues building your node, here are some common errors and possible solutions.

### Failed to Connect to Bootstrap Nodes[​](#failed-to-connect-to-bootstrap-nodes "Direct link to heading")

Error: `WARN node/node.go:291 failed to connect to bootstrap nodes`

This error can occur when the node doesn't have access to the Internet or if the NodeID is already being used by a different node in the network. This can occur when an old instance is running and not terminated.

### Cannot Query Unfinalized Data[​](#cannot-query-unfinalized-data "Direct link to heading")

Error: `err="cannot query unfinalized data"`

There may be a number of reasons for this issue, but it is likely that the node is not connected properly to other validators, which is usually caused by networking misconfiguration (wrong public IP, closed p2p port 9651).
