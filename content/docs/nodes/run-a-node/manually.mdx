description: Learn how to run an Avalanche node manually.
---

The quickest way to learn about Avalanche is by running a node and interacting with the network.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Install AvalancheGo and run an Avalanche node
- Connect to Avalanche

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Other Options">
- To use a third-party service to host your node or run a validator, [see here](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/on-third-party-services/amazon-web-services) for dedicated tutorials.  
- If you're just interested in setting up a node for staking, it's recommended to follow the [AvalancheGo Install Script](/docs/nodes/using-install-script/installing-avalanche-go) tutorial.

Hardware and OS Requirements[​](#hardware-and-os-requirements "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity hardware. Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may change.

- CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- RAM: 16 GiB
- Storage: 1 TiB SSD
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

<Callout type="warn">
Please do not try running a node on an HDD, as you may get poor and random read/write latencies, therefore reducing performance and reliability.
</Callout>

Run an Avalanche Node from Source[​](#run-an-avalanche-node-from-source "Direct link to heading")

Run with Docker[​](#run-with-docker "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------

See the [AvalancheGo GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#docker-install) repository for more information.

Networking[​](#networking "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

To run successfully, AvalancheGo needs to accept connections from the Internet on the network port `9651`. Before you proceed with the installation, you need to determine the networking environment your node will run in.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Running on a Cloud Provider">
If your node is running on a cloud provider computer instance, it will have a static IP. Find out what that static IP is, or set it up if you didn't already.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Running on a Home Connection">
If you're running a node on a computer that is on a residential internet connection, you have a dynamic IP; that is, your IP will change periodically. **For the sake of demonstration, you can ignore the following information.** Otherwise, you will need to set up inbound port forwarding of port `9651` from the internet to the computer the node is installed on.

As there are too many models and router configurations, we cannot provide instructions on what exactly to do, but there are online guides to be found (like [this](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/), or [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/) ), and your service provider support might help too.
<Callout type="warn">
Please note that a fully connected Avalanche node maintains and communicates over a couple of thousand of live TCP connections. For some low-powered and older home routers that might be too much to handle. If that is the case you may experience lagging on other computers connected to the same router, node getting benched, failing to sync and similar issues.
</Callout>
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout title="Note">
To be able to make API calls to your node from other machines, include the argument `--http-host=` when starting the node.
</Callout>

## Bootstrapping

A new node needs to catch up to the latest network state before it can participate in consensus and serve API calls. This process (called bootstrapping) currently takes several days for a new node connected to Mainnet, and a day or so for a new node connected to Fuji Testnet. When a given chain is done bootstrapping, it will print logs like this:

```bash
[09-09|17:01:45.295] INFO <C Chain> snowman/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2qaFwDJtmCCbMKP4jRpJwH8EFws82Q2yC1HhWgAiy3tGrpGFeb"}
[09-09|17:01:46.199] INFO <P Chain> snowman/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2ofmPJuWZbdroCPEMv6aHGvZ45oa8SBp2reEm9gNxvFjnfSGFP"}
[09-09|17:01:51.628] INFO <X Chain> snowman/transitive.go:334 consensus starting {"lenFrontier": 1}
```

### Check Bootstrapping Progress[​](#check-bootstrapping-progress "Direct link to heading")

To check if a given chain is done bootstrapping, in another terminal window call [`info.isBootstrapped`](/docs/api-reference/info-api#infoisbootstrapped) by copying and pasting the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"X"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

If this returns `true`, the chain is bootstrapped; otherwise, it returns `false`. If you make other API calls to a chain that is not done bootstrapping, it will return `API call rejected because chain is not done bootstrapping`. If you are still experiencing issues please contact us on [Discord.](https://chat.avalabs.org/)

<Callout title="Note">
The 3 chains will bootstrap in the following order: P-chain, X-chain, C-chain.
</Callout>

Learn more about bootstrapping [here](/docs/nodes/maintain/bootstrapping).

RPC[​](#rpc "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------

When finished bootstrapping, the X, P, and C-Chain RPC endpoints will be:

```bash
localhost:9650/ext/bc/P
localhost:9650/ext/bc/X
localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

if run locally, or

```bash
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/P
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/X
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

if run on a cloud provider. The “XXX.XX.XX.XXX" should be replaced with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

For more information on the requests available at these endpoints, please see the [AvalancheGo API Reference](/docs/api-reference/quicklinks) documentation.

Going Further[​](#going-further "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------

Your Avalanche node will perform consensus on its own, but it is not yet a validator on the network. This means that the rest of the network will not query your node when sampling the network during consensus. If you want to add your node as a validator, check out [Add a Validator](/docs/nodes/validate/node-validator) to take it a step further.

Also check out the [Maintain](/docs/nodes/maintain/bootstrapping) section to learn about how to maintain and customize your node to fit your needs.

To track a Subnet with your node, head to the [Subnet Node](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/subnet-nodes) tutorial.
