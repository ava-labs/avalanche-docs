description: Learn how to run an Avalanche node that tracks an Avalanche L1.
---

This article describes how to run a node that tracks an Avalanche L1. It requires building AvalancheGo, adding Virtual Machine binaries as plugins to your local data directory, and running AvalancheGo to track these binaries.

This tutorial specifically covers tracking an Avalanche L1 built with Avalanche's [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm), the default [Virtual Machine](/docs/quick-start/virtual-machines) run by Avalanche L1s on Avalanche.

## Build AvalancheGo

It is recommended that you must complete [this comprehensive guide](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/from-source) which demonstrates how to build and run a basic Avalanche node from source.

## Build Avalanche L1 Binaries

After building AvalancheGo successfully,

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm):

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm.git
```
</Step>

<Step>
In the Subnet-EVM directory, run the build script, and save it in the `plugins` folder of your `.avalanchego` data directory. Name the plugin after the `VMID` of the Avalanche L1 you wish to track. The `VMID` of the WAGMI Avalanche L1 is the value beginning with **srEX...**

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm
./scripts/build.sh ~/.avalanchego/plugins/srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Where can I find Avalanche L1 parameters like VMID?">
VMID, Avalanche L1 ID (SubnetID), ChainID, and all other parameters can be found in the "Chain Info" section of the Avalanche L1 Explorer.

- [Avalanche Mainnet](https://subnets.avax.network/c-chain)
- [Fuji Testnet](https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi)
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
</Step>

<Step>
Create a file named `config.json` and add a `track-subnets` field that is populated with the `SubnetID` you wish to track. The `SubnetID` of the WAGMI Avalanche L1 is the value beginning with **28nr...**

```bash
cd ~/.avalanchego
echo '{"track-subnets": "28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY"}' > config.json
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Run the Node

Run AvalancheGo with the `—config-file` flag to start your node and ensure it tracks the Avalanche L1s included in the configuration file.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
./build/avalanchego --config-file ~/.avalanchego/config.json --network-id=fuji
```

<Callout title="Note">
Note: The above command includes the `--network-id=fuji` command because the WAGMI Avalanche L1 is deployed on Fuji Testnet.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Run L1 Node Without The Config File">
If you would prefer to track Avalanche L1s using a command line flag, you can instead use the `--track-subnets` flag. For example:

```bash
./build/avalanchego --track-subnets 28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY --network-id=fuji
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

You should now see terminal filled with logs and information to suggest the node is properly running and has began bootstrapping to the network.

## Bootstrapping and RPC Details

It may take a few hours for the node to fully [bootstrap](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/manually#bootstrapping) to the Avalanche Primary Network and tracked Avalanche L1s.

When finished bootstrapping, the endpoint will be:

```bash
localhost:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run locally, or:

```bash
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run on a cloud provider. The “X”s should be replaced with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

For more information on the requests available at these endpoints, please see the [Subnet-EVM API Reference](/docs/api-reference/subnet-evm-api) documentation.

Because each node is also tracking the Primary Network, those [RPC endpoints](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/manually#rpc) are available as well.
