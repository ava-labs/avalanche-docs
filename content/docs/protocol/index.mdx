Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications in one interoperable, decentralized, and highly scalable ecosystem.

Powered by a uniquely powerful [consensus mechanism](/learn/avalanche-consensus), Avalanche is the first ecosystem designed to accommodate the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality.

## Blazingly Fast

Avalanche employs the fastest consensus mechanism of any Layer 1 blockchain. The unique consensus mechanism enables quick finality and low latency: in less than 2 seconds, your transaction is effectively processed and verified.

## Built to Scale

Developers who build on Avalanche can build application-specific blockchains with complex rulesets or build on existing private or public Avalanche L1s in any language.

Avalanche is incredibly energy-efficient and can run easily on consumer-grade hardware. The entire Avalanche network consumes the same amount of energy as 46 US households, equivalent to 0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin.

Solidity developers can build on Avalanche's implementation of the EVM straight out-of-the box, or build their own custom Virtual Machine (VM) for advanced use cases.

## Advanced Security

Avalanche consensus scales to thousands of concurrent validators without suffering performance degradation making it one of the most secure protocols for internet scaling systems.

Permissionless and permissioned custom blockchains deployed as an Avalanche L1s can include custom rulesets designed to be compliant with legal and jurisdictional considerations.
