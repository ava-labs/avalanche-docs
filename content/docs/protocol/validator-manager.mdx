The Validator Manager contract suite allows Avalanche Layer 1s (L1s) to manage and enforce custom logic for validator sets through smart contracts.

### Choosing Between Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake Chains

Organizations may opt to run a Proof of Authority (PoA) or a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain based on their specific needs and objectives.

#### Proof of Authority

In a PoA chain, a limited number of validators are pre-approved and recognized entities. This model is ideal for organizations that require:

- **Control and Compliance**: Regulatory compliance or the need for trusted validators.
- **Simplified Governance**: Easier coordination among validators.

PoA is often used by private enterprises, consortiums, or government agencies where validator identity is crucial, and a controlled environment is preferred.

#### Proof of Stake

In a PoS chain, validators are selected based on the amount of stake (tokens) they hold and are willing to lock up. This model is suitable for organizations aiming for:

- **Decentralization**: Encouraging a wide distribution of validators.
- **Security**: Economic incentives align validator behavior with network health.
- **Community Participation**: Allowing token holders to participate in network validation.

PoS chains are ideal for public networks or organizations that wish to build an open ecosystem with active community involvement.


### Enforcing Custom Validation Logic via Smart Contracts

Avalanche L1s have the unique capability to enforce any validation logic that can be encoded via smart contracts. This flexibility allows developers and organizations to define custom rules and conditions for validator participation in their networks. By leveraging smart contracts, L1s can implement complex validation mechanisms, such as dynamic validator sets, customized staking requirements, or hybrid consensus models.

Smart contracts act as the governing code that dictates how validators are selected, how they behave, and under what conditions they can participate in the network. This programmable approach ensures that the validation logic is transparent, auditable, and can be updated or modified as needed to adapt to changing requirements or threats.
