title: Avalanche Network Protocol 
---

Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------

Avalanche network defines the core communication format between Avalanche nodes. It uses the [primitive serialization](/api-reference/standards/serialization) format for payload packing.

`"Containers"` are mentioned extensively in the description. A Container is simply a generic term for blocks.

This document describes the protocol for peer-to-peer communication using Protocol Buffers (proto3). The protocol defines a set of messages exchanged between peers in a peer-to-peer network. Each message is represented by the `Message` proto message, which can encapsulate various types of messages, including network messages, state-sync messages, bootstrapping messages, consensus messages, and application messages.

Message[​](#message "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------

The `Message` proto message is the main container for all peer-to-peer communication. It uses the `oneof` construct to represent different message types. The supported compression algorithms include Gzip and Zstd.

```
message Message {
  oneof message {
    bytes compressed_gzip = 1;
    bytes compressed_zstd = 2;
    // ... (other compression algorithms can be added)
    Ping ping = 11;
    Pong pong = 12;
    Version version = 13;
    PeerList peer_list = 14;
    // ... (other message types)
  }
}
```

### Compression[​](#compression "Direct link to heading")

The `compressed_gzip` and `compressed_zstd` fields are used for Gzip and Zstd compression, respectively, of the encapsulated message. These fields are set only if the message type supports compression.

Network Messages[​](#network-messages "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Ping[​](#ping "Direct link to heading")

The `Ping` message reports a peer's perceived uptime percentage.

```
message Ping {
  uint32 uptime = 1;
  repeated SubnetUptime subnet_uptimes = 2;
}
```

- `uptime`: Uptime percentage on the primary network \[0, 100\].
- `subnet_uptimes`: Uptime percentages on Subnets.

### Pong[​](#pong "Direct link to heading")

The `Pong` message is sent in response to a `Ping` with the perceived uptime of the peer.

```
message Pong {
  uint32 uptime = 1; // Deprecated: uptime is now sent in Ping
  repeated SubnetUptime subnet_uptimes = 2; // Deprecated: uptime is now sent in Ping
}
```

### Version[​](#version "Direct link to heading")

The `Version` message is the first outbound message sent to a peer during the p2p handshake.

```
message Version {
  uint32 network_id = 1;
  uint64 my_time = 2;
  bytes ip_addr = 3;
  uint32 ip_port = 4;
  string my_version = 5;
  uint64 my_version_time = 6;
  bytes sig = 7;
  repeated bytes tracked_subnets = 8;
}
```

- `network_id`: Network identifier (e.g., local, testnet, Mainnet).
- `my_time`: Unix timestamp when the `Version` message was created.
- `ip_addr`: IP address of the peer.
- `ip_port`: IP port of the peer.
- `my_version`: Avalanche client version.

```
message PeerList {
  repeated ClaimedIpPort claimed_ip_ports = 1;
}
```

- `claimed_ip_ports`: List of claimed IP and port pairs.

### PeerListAck[​](#peerlistack "Direct link to heading")

The `PeerListAck` message is sent in response to `PeerList` to acknowledge the subset of peers that the peer will attempt to connect to.

```
message PeerListAck {
  reserved 1; // deprecated; used to be tx_ids
  repeated PeerAck peer_acks = 2;
