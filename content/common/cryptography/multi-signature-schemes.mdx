Multi-signature schemes, also known as multi-sigs, are cryptographic methods enabling multiple parties to collectively authorize a specific action or operation, typically by requiring a predefined number of authorized participants to provide their digital signatures. In a multi-signature scheme, each authorized party possesses their own private key, and to validate the action. A specified subset of these parties must produce their unique signatures.

This is useful in scenarios where a group of participants want to collectively sign a message, but only a subset of them are needed to do so.

Multi-signature schemes enhance security by reducing the reliance on a single entity, mitigating risks associated with compromised keys, and enabling shared control over various cryptographic processes. These schemes find applications in a wide range of cryptographic and security contexts, where they help ensure trust, distribute control, and minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## BLS  Multi-Signature Scheme

The [BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) multi-signature scheme](https://iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2001/22480516.pdf) is notable for its compact size, making it a highly efficient for blockchain application. Furthermore, it supports signature and public key aggregation.  

- Signature aggregation compresses all signatures into a single short signature, which makes the transportation and verification much more efficient.
- Public Key aggregation allows the verification algorithm to only use a short aggregated public key. 

The BLS multi-signature scheme has applications in various cryptographic protocols, such as secure multi-party computation, distributed key generation, threshold decryption, and more. They are particularly useful in decentralized systems like blockchain networks, where multiple parties may need to collaboratively sign messages or perform other cryptographic operations.
