Let's get our hands dirty and use a signature scheme. We'll take the following steps:

- **Generate Key Pair**: We will generate a key pair consisting of a Public and a Secret Key.
- **Sign Message**: We create a Signature by signing the Message with the Secret Key.
- **Verify Signature**: We verify the Signature of a Message with the Public Key.

### Verify the Signature

Anyone, that has access to your Public Key corresponding to the Private Key used for signing the message can now verify the signature of the Message. Therefore, the Authenticity, Non-Repudiation and Integrity of the Message can be trusted.
