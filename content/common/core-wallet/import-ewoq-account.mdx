The ewoq address is an address where the private key is commonly known. It makes testing easier, since we can preconfigure the private key and don't have to create a new one every time.

**Address:** 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC

**Private Key:** 56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027

> Do not send any funds on any public blockchain to the ewoq address. The funds will most likely be lost immediately.

To add the private key to your core wallet, open the core extension and navigate to the `Account Manager`. Then click the `arrow button` and select `Import Private Key`.

You can also change the account name. Click on the three dots, then `View Details` and then `edit` at the top right. 

> We highly recommend setting the name to something like `Do not use` to avoid accidentally using the ewoq account for any real funds.
