The Avalanche Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Avalanche. Among other tools it contains Avalanche CLI. With that you can set up a local network, create a Avalanche L1, customize the Avalanche L1/VM configuration, and so on. 

In this course we will run the Avalanche Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the most quick way to get started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open the Avalanche Starter Kit Github Repository:

<Link
    href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Avalanche Starter Kit</Link>
</Step>
<Step>

### Create a Codespace
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=310064032)
The Codespace will open in a new tab. Wait a few minutes until it's fully built.

</Step>

### Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

Now enter avalanche -h to verify everything is working:

```bash
avalanche -h
```

As a result you should see the help of Avalanche CLI:

```
Avalanche-CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers access to
everything Avalanche. This release specializes in helping developers
build and test Avalanche L1s.

To get started, look at the documentation for the subcommands or jump right
in with avalanche blockchain create myNewAvalanche L1.

Usage:
  avalanche [command]

Available Commands:
  config                Modify configuration for Avalanche-CLI
  help                  Help about any command
  key                   Create and manage testnet signing keys
```

</Step>

### Optional: Open Codespace locally in Visual Studio Code

You can switch any time from the browser IDE to Visual Studio Code:

The first time you switch, you will be asked to install the [Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) and connect VS Code to you GitHub account, if it is not already connceted.
