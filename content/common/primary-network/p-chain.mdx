In the Avalanche Network, the P-Chain of the Primary Network is responsible for all validator and Avalanche L1-level operations. The P-Chain supports the creation of new blockchains and Avalanche L1s, the addition of validators to Avalanche L1s, staking operations, and other platform-level operations.

Each Avalanche validator can register a BLS public key alongside its NodeID on the Avalanche P-Chain. Validators of Avalanche L1s can stake different amounts of the Avalanche L1's staking token. Through the P-Chain, we can determine a weighted set of BLS Public Keys that correspond to the validators of each Avalanche L1 on the Avalanche Network.

Anyone can see on the P-Chain the current weighted validator sets of every Avalanche L1 and how the set has evolved over time.
