The Native Minter Precompile allows for fine-grained permissioning which address can mint more native tokens. There can be rich permissioning structures around precompiles with three roles.

These addresses are not necessarily owned by a single entity, but can also be managed by a multi-sig or DAO.

## Initial permissions

If the native minter precompile is activated, the initial addresses can be set in genesis.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

If only an enabled address is set, only that address can mint native tokens. Allowing another address to mint native tokens would require a network upgrade.

## Interacting with the NativeMinter from Solidity

The Stateful Precompile contract powering the ContractNativeMinter adheres to the following Solidity interface at `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`:

```solidity title="Native Minter"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface INativeMinter is IAllowList {
  event NativeCoinMinted(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

  // Mint [amount] number of native coins and send to [addr]
  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;
}

interface IAllowList {
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Enabled addresses can mint native tokens
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;  

  // Admins can mint native tokens and enable/disable addresses
  function setManager(address addr) external;
  
  // Admins can mint native tokens and enable/disable addresses and give/revoke manager and admin rights
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Revoke the role from that address
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

mintNativeCoin takes an address and amount of native coins to be minted. The amount denotes the amount in minimum denomination of native coins (10^18). For example, if you want to mint 1 native coin (in AVAX), you need to pass 1 * 10^18 as the amount. A NativeCoinMinted event is emitted with the sender, recipient and amount when a native coin is minted.
