The AllowList allows a precompile to enforce permissions on addresses. The AllowList is not a contract itself, but a helper structure providing a control mechanism for wrapping contracts. It provides an AllowListConfig to the precompile so that it can take an initial configuration from genesis/upgrade.

Precompiles using an Allow List have two roles: Admin, Manager and Enabled. For each role, a list of addresses can be defined.

- Enabled addresses can perform the permissioned behavior (issuing transactions, deploying contracts, etc.), but cannot modify other roles.
- Manager addresses can use the precompile, and can change enabled addresses
- Admin addresses have the same rights, but can also add/remove other Admin, Manager and Enabled addresses.

These addresses are not necessarily owned by a single entity, but can also be managed by a multi-sig or DAO.

AllowList adds adminAddresses and enabledAddresses fields to precompile contract configurations. For instance, txAllowList precompile contract configuration looks like this:

```json
"txAllowListConfig": {
  "blockTimestamp": 0,
  "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC","0x0000...", "... and more"],
  "enabledAddresses": ["... and even more"]
}
```

AllowList configuration affects only the related precompile. For instance, the admin address in txAllowList does not affect admin addresses in other activated precompiles.

## Interacting with the AllowList from Solidity

The AllowList Solidity interface is defined below. AllowList is not an actual contract but just an interface. It's not callable by itself. This is used by other precompiles.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IAllowList {
  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;
  
  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;
  
  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

`readAllowList(addr)` will return a `uint256` with a value of `0`, `1`, `2` or `3`, corresponding to the roles None, Enabled, Admin and Manager respectively.
