The Transaction Allowlist allows an Avalanche L1 to restrict who can issue transactions to the chain. This is useful for preventing unwanted behavior. If an address is not on the allowlist, the chain will reject any transactions from that address.

This can be used to implement a permissioned chain, where only certain addresses are allowed to interact with the chain. This can be useful for enterprise use cases, where only certain entities are allowed to interact with the chain or usecases that require every user to go through a KYC-process.
