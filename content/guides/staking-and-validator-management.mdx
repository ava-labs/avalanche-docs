## What are L1 Validators?

Introduced with ACP-77, [Avalanche L1 Validators](https://build.avax.network/guides/subnet-vs-l1-validators) 
enable the creation of sovereign L1 networks with minimal dependency on the Avalanche Primary Network. 
Each L1 manages their own validators with a validator manager smart contract.

## What is a Validator Manager Smart Contract? 

A Validator Manager smart contract (VMC) is one or many smart contracts that work together to define the logic for
L1 validator addition and removal on an Avalanche L1.

ACP-77 enables any Avalanche L1 to independently manage its own validators. When an L1 network is established, the
Avalanche P-Chain requires each L1 to specify the address that controls the validator set. This address is
responsible for using Inter-chain messaging (ICM) to correspond with the P-Chain, notifying the network whenever a
validator is added or removed from the L1. This address should be set to the contract address of the chosen PoA or
PoS VMC. 

The ICM-Contracts repository hosts a standard suite of [validator-manager](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/README.md)
smart contracts that can define standard,
minimal functionality for either PoA and PoS L1 networks. This library is maintained by the Avalanche Platform
Engineers, and is open to use and extension by any developer in the ecosystem.

## Where Can I Deploy the Validator Manager Contract? 

The contract for controlling the validators of any L1 can be deployed on any blockchain in the Avalanche Network. Most
chains will choose to deploy their validator manager contract on either (a) the Avalanche C-Chain or (b) the L1 it
controls. 

## Proof-of-Authority Networks

If building a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network, ideally the VMC should be deployed on the L1 chain it is managing so
that the native gas token can be used to pay for validator management transactions. Due to the nature of PoA chains,
the validators would be managed by the creators of the chain, meaning any transactions paid for with the L1's native
gas token would be given the chain creator owns most, if not all of the supply. Without the requirement to stake any
tokens in order to validate, PoA chains can create and instantiate the validators at the time of chain creation, and
maintain the [P-Chain validator fee](https://build.avax.network/guides/l1-validator-fee) for the foreseeable future.

## Proof-of-Stake Networks

If designing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Avalanche L1, the validator manager contract must be deployed on the same 
blockchain as the reward token that is being distributed, accompanied by a contract to [calculate validation rewards](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/ExampleRewardCalculator.sol). 
The reward token can be either an ERC20 token or the native token of the L1. The VMC must have minting privileges 
for the reward token, either by enabling the Native Minter Precompile if the VMC is deployed on the L1 it controls,
or via the [ERC20Mintable](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/interfaces/IERC20Mintable.sol) interface provided in the ICM-Contracts repo if the VMC is deployed on C-Chain or a 
blockchain other than the L1 itself. Ultimately, the staking token must have a supply that's controlled exclusively 
by the VMC and L1 blockchain itself. 

Because most cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, and onramps are more likely to sync and index older, more 
established chains, deploying the VMC and ERC20 Staking Token contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain, in most cases, 
would expedite the time needed to have the staking token listed. The ERC20 staking token VMC controls the supply 
and distribution of the staking token when rewarding validators. 

However, if a PoS L1 aims to use transaction fees as a mechanism for generating validator rewards, implementing 
[native token](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/README.md#nativetokenstakingmanager)
staking offers a streamlined approach to reward distribution. By using the network's native token for 
staking, transaction fees collected from users can be directly recycled and distributed to validators without the 
need for complex processes like burning and re-minting tokens. This simplifies the economic model, reduces 
operational overhead, and ensures a more efficient flow of value within the ecosystem. 

It's important to note that a counterargument exists against the use of transaction fees for value accrual: most
blockchains aim to have the lowest gas fees possible. A better user experience for transactors on-chain usually
includes a fee that is so low, you barely notice it. If the fee is as low as possible, it wouldn't be a great
method of value accrual for an L1's validators; instead of this, the chain can employ a token emissions or token 
inflation scheme, such as the many tokenomics models present on chains like [Avalanche](https://build.avax.network/docs/quick-start/avax-token#tokenomics)
and [Ethereum](https://consensys.io/blog/your-guide-to-ethereum-validator-staking-rewards). Other mechanisms
can also be employed, such as using fees generated by any on-chain applications to [buy back](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees)
tokens and either hold them in a fund or distribute them to the community.

Regardless of the choice of reward mechanism, native token staking using the ICM-Contracts implementation must be
deployed on the L1's blockchain. Staking rewards are minted by enabling the Native Minter Precompile on the L1's
Subnet-EVM binary, which is configured with a set of addresses with minting privileges of the L1's native token.
As such, the EVM address that NativeTokenStakingManager is deployed to must be added as an admin to the precompile.

Because the supply of the native token will be controlled on the L1 itself, a native staking token may still be
bridged to Avalanche C-Chain as a Wrapped ERC20 token and listed on exchanges without the need to index the L1 
chain. 

## Conclusion

In summary, managing L1 validators on Avalanche involves deploying and configuring Validator Manager Contracts
(VMCs). These contracts, which can be customized for Proof-of-Authority (PoA) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks,
dictate how validators are added and removed. The deployment location of the VMC, along with the choice of reward
mechanism (ERC20 tokens or native tokens), are critical design decisions that impact the L1's functionality and
integration with the broader Avalanche ecosystem. 

Developers looking to implement or extend these functionalities can leverage the standard suite of validator-manager
smart contracts available in the [ICM-Contracts](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/README.md)
repository. Detailed information can be found in the [developer documentation](https://build.avax.network/docs/cross-chain/teleporter/overview).
