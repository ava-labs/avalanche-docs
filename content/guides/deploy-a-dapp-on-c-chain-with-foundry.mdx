Foundry toolchain is a smart contract development toolchain written in Rust. It manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line.

# Recommended Knowledge

- Basic understanding of Solidity and Avalanche.
- You are familiar with Avalanche Smart Contract Quickstart.
- Basic understanding of the Avalanche's architecture

# Run Avalanche Starter Kit

import SetUp from "@/content/common/avalanche-starter-kit/set-up.mdx";

import defaultMdxComponents from "fumadocs-ui/mdx";

<SetUp components={defaultMdxComponents}/>

# Create a Smart Contract

Create a new Solidity file in the `src` directory of your project. For example, `src/MyContract.sol`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    uint256 public myNumber;

    function setNumber(uint256 _num) public {
        myNumber = _num;
    }
}
```

# Create Deployment Address

You can create a new wallet with the case command:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

# Fund Your Account

Go the the faucet and fund the address with Fuji AVAX. You can use the code `avalanche-academy`:

[Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c)

# Deploy the Smart Contract

With foundry's `forge` command, you can deploy your smart contract to the Fuji C-Chain.

```shell
forge create --rpc-url fuji-c --private-key <private-key> src/MyContract.sol:MyContract
```
