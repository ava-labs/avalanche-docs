The AWM Relayer is an application run independently of the blockchain clients. Anyone can run their own AWM Relayer to create a communication channel between two Avalanche L1s, and there can be multiple relayers for the same communication channel. There is an open source implementation anyone can use [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer). 

[AvaCloud](https://www.avacloud.io) also offers their own hosted relayers.

The AWM Relayers are responsible for picking up the messages at the source Avalanche L1, aggregating the BLS signatures from a sufficiently large share of the source Avalanche L1's validators and submitting a transaction on the destination Avalanche L1.

It is up to the cross-chain application to decide if they allow any relayer to be part of the delivery process, or whether to restrict participation to certain Relayers.

## AWM Relayer Config

The AWM Relayer can be configured so that it is reusable for different networks (Mainnet, Fuji Testnet, Local) and communication channels between Avalanche L1s. The following configurations are available:

- **Info API URL:** An RPC endpoint where the AWM Relayer can access the Info API to retrieve the information about the network
- **P-Chain API URL:** An RPC endpoint where the AWM Relayer can access the P-Chain to retrieve the validators of the source Avalanche L1
- **Source Avalanche L1 Configs:** An array of configurations for the source Avalanche L1s where the messages are picked up from
- **Destination Avalanche L1 Configs:** An array of configurations for the destination Avalanche L1s where the messages are delivered to
