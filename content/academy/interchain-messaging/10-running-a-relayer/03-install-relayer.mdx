The binary for the Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) relayer can be acquired in multiple ways:

- **Download from GitHub Release:** For every release the binary is uploaded to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer/releases)
- **Use Docker:** The Docker image is available under the tag `avaplatform/awm-relayer:latest` on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/avaplatform/awm-relayer)
- **Build from Source:** You can also build it from source directly if you want to make modifications or run it on a different platform. The source code is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer?tab=readme-ov-file#building)

When using the [Avalanche Starter Kit](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit) the relayer is already included in the Dev Container. You can start the relayer by running the following command:

```bash
avalanche interchain relayer start
```
