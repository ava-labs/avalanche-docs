When you deploy your own chain using Avalanche CLI in the Avalanche Starter-kit it offers you to run a relayer on launch. This will automatically run a relayer that delivers any message between the local Avalanche L1s. We will cover configuration in the next section, but for now you will need to learn some basic commands.

## Stopping the Relayer

If you want to stop the relayer, you can use the following command:

```bash
avalanche teleporter relayer stop
```

## Starting the Relayer

If you want to start the relayer, you can use the following command:

```bash
avalanche teleporter relayer start
```
