In this section, you will learn how to request random words from Chainlink VRF using both the `CrossChainVRFConsumer` contracts.

## Authorize an Address to Request Random Words

After deploying the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` contract, the first step is to authorize an address to make requests for random words. This ensures that only specific addresses linked to a subscription can request VRF.

- Use the `addAuthorizedAddress` function to authorize a specific address with a given subscription ID. This step allows the address to make random word requests through the wrapper.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> $VRF_WRAPPER "addAuthorizedAddress(address caller, uint256 subscriptionId)" $VRF_CONSUMER $VRF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

</Step>

## Request Random Words from `CrossChainVRFConsumer`

Once the address is authorized, the next step is to send a request for random words from the `CrossChainVRFConsumer` contract on the unsupported L1. This request is then sent to the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` via a cross-chain message.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> $VRF_CONSUMER "requestRandomWords(bytes32 keyHash, uint16 requestConfirmations, uint32 callbackGasLimit, uint32 numWords, bool nativePayment, uint32 requiredGasLimit)" <KEY_HASH> <CONFIRMATIONS> <GAS_LIMIT> <NUM_WORDS> <NATIVE_PAYMENT> <REQUIRED_GAS_LIMIT>
```

Replace the placeholders with:

- `<KEY_HASH>`: The VRF key hash used for random word generation.
- `<CONFIRMATIONS>`: Number of confirmations required for the request.
- `<GAS_LIMIT>`: The gas limit for the VRF callback function.
- `<NUM_WORDS>`: The number of random words requested.
- `<NATIVE_PAYMENT>`: Indicates whether the payment will be made in the native token.
- `<REQUIRED_GAS_LIMIT>`: The gas limit required for the cross-chain message to be processed.
