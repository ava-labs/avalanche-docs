Once you have set up your Chainlink VRF subscription and have your LINK tokens ready, the next step is to deploy the **CrossChainVRFWrapper** contract. This contract will act as the bridge between your unsupported L1 and the Chainlink VRF network on a supported L1, enabling cross-chain requests for random words.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Prerequisites
Before deployment, make sure you have:
- A valid **Chainlink VRF Subscription ID** (see previous section for details).
- The `TeleporterMessenger` contract address on your supported L1 (e.g., Avalanche Fuji).
</Step>
<Step>

## Deploy the Contract
Using the `forge create` command, deploy the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` contract to the supported L1 (e.g., Avalanche Fuji).

```bash
forge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/CrossChainVRFWrapper.sol:CrossChainVRFWrapper --constructor-args <TELEPORTER_MESSENGER_ADDRESS>
```

Replace the following:

- `<RPC_URL>`: The RPC URL for the L1.
- `<PRIVATE_KEY>`: The private key for the account used to deploy the contract.
- `<TELEPORTER_MESSENGER_ADDRESS>`: The address of the deployed `TeleporterMessenger` contract.

After deployment, save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable for future use.

```bash
export VRF_WRAPPER=<address>
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Verify the Deployment
After deploying the contract, verify that the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` has been successfully deployed by checking its address on a block explorer.

</Step>
<Step>

## Configure Authorized Subscriptions
Once deployed, the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` contract needs to be configured with authorized subscriptions to process requests for random words.

- Call the `addAuthorizedAddress` function to authorize a specific address with a given subscription ID.
- This ensures that only authorized addresses can request random words via the wrapper.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> $VRF_WRAPPER "addAuthorizedAddress(address caller, uint256 subscriptionId)" <CALLER_ADDRESS> <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
```

Replace the following:

- `<CALLER_ADDRESS>`: The address that will be authorized to request random words.
- `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`: The ID of your Chainlink VRF subscription.
</Step>
