Well done, you successfully learned how to send simple data back and forth between blockchains. In this section we will look further and invoke a smart contract function on the destination chain.

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- **Encoding:** Most smart contract functions have multiple parameters. So the first thing we will learn is how to encode multiple values in the message
- **Specify which function to call:** Most smart contracts have multiple functions. We will learn how to specify which function to call and encode different parameters depending on which function is been called

## Exercise

In this section you will apply the learned knowledge by building a cross-chain dApp where multiple functions are called on the destination chain.

- Build a Calculator that takes two parameters and adds them up
- Modify the Calculator to support more functions that can be called from the source Avalanche L1
