Alright, now let's call our Calculators:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Call the Sender Contract

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendAddMessage(address, uint256, uint256)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS 2 3
```

We need to call the `sendAddMessage` function on the sender contract with the address of the receiver contract and the two numbers we want to add. 

For this example we will add 2 + 3.

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Message Receipt

To check wether the message has been received, we can call the `result_num()` function on the `Receiver` contract. 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "result_num()(uint)"
```

```bash
5
```
2 + 3 = 5. Our cross-chain calculation was successful!
</Step>
