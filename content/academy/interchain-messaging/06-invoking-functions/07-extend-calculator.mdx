Now let's add a third feature to the calculator: adding three numbers. We want you to practice handling different amounts of parameters depending on the action to perform, so your task will be to add a `tripleSum` function that sums up three values of the type uint. 

You will need to:

- Add the `trippleSum` action to the enum file
- Add a new encode helper and send function to the sender contract
- Add a new route to the receiver and implement the `tripleSum` function

Check out the solution under `/contracts/interchain-messaging/2c-invoking-functions` on the Avalanche-Starter-Kit
