The final step, is to send the message between the two chains. Assuming everything went smooth so far, your local C-chain and your Avalanche L1 will have their corresponding parts of the sender/receiver deployed on them.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Send a Message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address,string)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "Hello"
```

A relayer launched when you deployed the Avalanche L1 will now take the message and deliver it to the destination.

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Message was Received

Now let's check if the "Hello" string sent from our C-chain was actually stored properly on the `lastMessage` variable on our Avalanche L1. Run the following command replacing the receiver contract address.

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "lastMessage()(string)"
```

If the output says `Hello` then the message was successfully delivered and processed.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have just sent your first cross-chain message. This will be one of many to come!
