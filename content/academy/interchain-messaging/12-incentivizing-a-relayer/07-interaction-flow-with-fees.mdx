Now we have all the Smart Contract ðŸ“œ set we can start sending incentivized cross-chain messages. Now let complete the flow 

- Deploy sender contract on C-Chain
- Deploy receiver contract on `myblockchain`
- Approve the sender contract to spend ERC20 funds from the message sender address
- Send the message

<Steps>
<Step>

### Deploy Sender Contract 

To deploy the sender contract run:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/senderWithFees.sol:SenderWithFeesOnCChain
```
```

```

</Step>
<Step>
### Save the Sender Contract Address

```bash
export SENDER_ADDRESS=0xa4DfF80B4a1D748BF28BC4A271eD834689Ea3407
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Receiver Contract

Now, deploy the receiver contract.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/receiverWithFees.sol:ReceiverOnSubnet
```
```

```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Receiver Contract Address

```bash
export RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0xe336d36FacA76840407e6836d26119E1EcE0A2b4
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Approve ERC20 Token Expense

ðŸ‘© The Message Sender (User) requires to approve the Cross-Avalanche L1 dApp as a spender on the ERC20 contract to be used as fee. To do that lets use the function "approve" on our deployed FEE contract.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_fee_address "approve(address,uint256)" $SENDER_ADDRESS 500000000000000
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Send an incentivized message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address, string, address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "Hello" $ERC20_fee_address
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify message was received on Avalanche L1 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "lastMessage()(string)"
```
```bash
"Hello"
```

**Success!** The message was received on the destination chain while incentivizing the Relayer.
