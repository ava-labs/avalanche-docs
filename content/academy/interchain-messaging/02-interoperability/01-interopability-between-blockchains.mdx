Interoperability between blockchains refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with one another in a seamless and coordinated manner. It allows these separate blockchain systems to share data, assets, or functionalities, enabling them to work together as if they were part of a single unified network.

These interactions can take many forms, including:

- Asset Bridging (Tokens, NFTs, etc.)
- DAO Voting across Chains
- Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools

As you will see soon, these different interactions are based on the same fundamentals of blockchains exchanging messages.

## What you will learn

In this section, you will explore the following topics:

- **Source, Message, and Destination:** What is a message and what are the roles of the source and destination blockchain in interoperability?
- **Multi-Chain Systems:** A quick recap of multi-chain systems
- **Interoperability in Multi-Chain Systems:** Learn about the importance of interoperability to multi-chain systems
