In this segment, we'll delve into the mechanisms of restricting relayers for transmitting messages across Avalanche L1s. While the security in AWM and Interchain Messaging doesn't rely at all on the Relayer, there might be some reasons why you would want to restrict the delivery of the message to certain Relayers. 

The more obvious one is when you run your own Relayer, and don't want to incentivize any other to ensure your message gets to the destination. On following sections you will learn how to run your own Relayer so you can restrict the messages to your own.

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- **Allowed Relayers:** Learn how to restrict the relayer for transmitting messages across Avalanche L1s
- **Dynamically update the allowed Relayers:** Understand how to update the allowed relayers dynamically
