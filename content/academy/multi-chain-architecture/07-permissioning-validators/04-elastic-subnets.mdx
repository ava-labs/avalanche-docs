The Elastic Avalanche L1s feature empowers Avalanche L1 creators with an unprecedented ability: activating Proof-of-Stake validation and uptime-based rewards using their own tokens on their own Avalanche L1. For the first time, anyone can become a validator of an Avalanche L1 by simply staking its token on the Platform Chain, or P-Chain.

When an Avalanche L1 enables Elastic Validation, it undergoes a one-time transformation, resulting in an Elastic Avalanche L1. Here's the catch - this process locks the Avalanche L1 from future modifications, and the creator relinquishes their control keys.

To enable Elastic Validation, creators need to specify an Avalanche Native Token (ANT) that validators will stake and receive as rewards. They also have to establish a set of parameters to dictate the staking mechanics.

Turning on Elastic Validation is purely optional and lies at the discretion of the creator. Creators who prefer to have more control over a Avalanche L1's validator set can retain the default configuration, which designates specific nodes as validators.

You can use Avalanche Native Tokens from the X-Chain as stakeable tokens on Elastic Avalanche L1s or ERC-20s as ANTs, which can be used as stakeable and rewardable assets on Elastic Avalanche L1s.

Avalanche L1 creators can remove a validator before the end of its staking period. If the Avalanche L1 is already Elastic, an Avalanche L1 creator can also remove validators added before token-based staking was enabled.

These features give creators more control and options for configuring their Avalanche L1s, providing a more versatile and dynamic blockchain ecosystem.
