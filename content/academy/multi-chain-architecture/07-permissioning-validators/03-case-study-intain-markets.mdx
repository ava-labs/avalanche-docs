Intain operates a structured finance platform. It has **IntainMARKETS**, a marketplace for tokenized asset-backed securities built as an Avalanche L1.

The digital marketplace automates and integrates functions of key stakeholders in structured finance, including issuer, verification agent, underwriter, rating agency, servicer, trustee, and investor.

Rather than replacing trust intermediaries, it integrates them onto a single platform  to enable digital issuance and investment with a complete on-chain workflow. All parties work together in a transparent but private environment.

## Permissioned Validators and Tokenomics

The **IntainMARKETS L1** also uses other ways to adhere to regulatory requirements. It has U.S-hosted infrastructure, which allows data to reside domestically, while validators chosen by network participants must also be verified U.S. entities and individuals. The Avalanche L1 economics are not dependent on any public token, and transaction costs are independent from those of the Avalanche C-Chain and other Avalanche L1s.
