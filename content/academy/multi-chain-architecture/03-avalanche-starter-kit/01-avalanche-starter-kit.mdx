To make easier your journey through this course, we have prepared a Starter Kit repo consisting of everything you will need to start developing your own custom blockchains on Avalanche. This repo will provide a self-contained environment with Avalanche-CLI, and Foundry so you can follow the course without the need of installing anything else other than launching the environment.

# What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- How to launch your own Codespace
- Create your own Avalanche Interchain Messaging enabled custom blockchain
- Foundry configuration

At the end of this section, you will have your environment ready to follow with the Cross-Chain development with Avalanche Interchain Messaging.
