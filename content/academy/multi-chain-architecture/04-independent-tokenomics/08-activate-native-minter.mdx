When prompted if you want to allow minting of new natie tokens, select **Yes**.

```
? Allow minting of new native tokens?: 
    No, I want the supply of the native tokens be hard-capped
  ▸ Yes, I want to be able to mint additional the native tokens (Native Minter Precompile ON)
```

Let's add an address as an admin for our native token minting:

```
? Configure the addresses that are allowed to mint native tokens: 
  ▸ Add an address for a role to the allow list
    Preview Allow List
    Confirm Allow List
    Cancel
```

First you will be asked what role the address should have. Select `Admin` here:

```
? What role should the address have?: 
  ▸ Admin
    Manager
    Enabled
    Explain the difference
    Cancel
```

Now enter this address and confirm with enter: `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`

Feel free to add more addresses here. Note that every address added here is an Admin. After setting all the admin addresses, go to `Confirm Allow List` and press enter.

```
? Configure the addresses that are allowed to mint native tokens: 
    Add an address for a role to the allow list
    Remove address from the allow list
    Preview Allow List
  ▸ Confirm Allow List
    Cancel
```

You will be shown a preview of the allowlist. Confirm with `Yes`.
