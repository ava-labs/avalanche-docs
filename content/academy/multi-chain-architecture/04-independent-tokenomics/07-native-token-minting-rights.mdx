Many chains have a hard-capped supply for their gas token. The Avalanche C-Chain uses AVAX as their gas token and there will only ever be 720m AVAX. This may not be optimal for enterprise use cases, especially if they want to **create an experience with a valueless gas token**.

Therefore, they have the option to mint more native tokens at any time. This can be done through the **Native Minter Precompile**. If a community running an Avalanche L1 wants to hard-cap the native token, that is perfectly doable as well. They just keep the native minter capabilities deactivated (which is the default).

import NativeMinter from "@/content/common/evm-precompiles/native-minter.mdx";

import defaultMdxComponents from "fumadocs-ui/mdx";

<NativeMinter components={defaultMdxComponents}/>
