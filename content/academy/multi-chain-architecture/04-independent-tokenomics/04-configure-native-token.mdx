Let's create a new Avalanche L1 and spend some more attention on how we can configure our native token. So let's run again `avalanche blockchain create myblockchain2`. We will pick again `Subnet-EVM` as our Virtual Machine. However, this time we will not use the default settings:

```bash
? Do you want to use default values for the Blockchain configuration?: 
    I want to use defaults for a test environment
    I want to use defaults for a production environment
  â–¸ I don't want to use default values
    Explain the difference
```

Choose to use the `latest version` of Subnet-EVM and pick a ChainID different from your first subnet (e.g. 8888). 

Next you can select a custom token symbol.

Now, we have configured our own token. In the next step we will look at the inital token allocation.
