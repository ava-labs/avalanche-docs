Avalanche Custom Blockchains offer multiple ways to implement independent tokenomics. This gives developers more control and can enable new business model that would not be economically feasible on single-chain systems.

The customizations include:

- **Native Token:** Every Avalanche L1 has their own native token used for paying transaction fees. 
- **Transaction Fees:** We can configure how the transaction fees should be calculated.   
- **Initial Native Token Allocation:** We can specify how the inital token supply is distributed.
- **Native Token Minting Rights:** We can specify if and who can mint more native tokens.
- **Staking Token:** If our Avalanche L1 allows public and permissionless validation, we can define our logic how a node can become a validator.

You will learn about all these topics and get hands-on experience how you can configure the tokenomics of your own custom blockchain.
