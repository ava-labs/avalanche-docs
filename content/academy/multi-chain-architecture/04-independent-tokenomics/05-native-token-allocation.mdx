The creator of an Avalanche L1 can pre-allocate the native tokens during the chain genesis event. The initial token allocation of a blockchain refers to the distribution of tokens or digital assets when a new blockchain network is launched.

This allocation is a critical aspect of the network's design, as it determines how tokens are distributed among various stakeholders and participants.

There are several considerations that go into the initial token allocation:

- **Founders and Development Team:** Often, a portion of the initial token supply is allocated to the founders and development team as a reward for their efforts in creating the blockchain protocol. This allocation serves as an incentive for them to continue developing and maintaining the network.
- **Early Investors and Backers:** Another portion of the token supply may be allocated to early investors and backers who provided funding or support during the project's early stages. These individuals or entities take on early risk and are rewarded with tokens that may increase in value as the network grows.
- **Community:** A significant portion of tokens may be allocated to the community through mechanisms such as a token sale, airdrops, or other distribution methods. This ensures widespread ownership and participation in the network, fostering decentralization and security.
- **Reserve:** Some tokens may be allocated to a reserve or treasury to fund ongoing development, marketing, and ecosystem growth initiatives. This reserve can be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a designated entity responsible for allocating funds in the best interest of the network.

Overall, the initial token allocation of a blockchain is a complex and crucial aspect of its design, shaping the network's distribution of ownership, governance, and incentives from the very beginning.

Transparent and equitable token allocation mechanisms are essential for fostering trust and confidence in the network among its stakeholders.
