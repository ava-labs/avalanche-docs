Alright, let's get to configuring our gas fees. When prompted select **Customize fee config**.

```
? How should the transaction fees be configured on your Blockchain?: 
    Low block size    / Low Throughput    12 mil gas per block
    Medium block size / Medium Throughput 15 mil gas per block (C-Chain's setting)
    High block size   / High Throughput   20 mil gas per block
  ▸ Customize fee config
    Explain the difference
```

Let's assume we are creating an enterprise blockchain with very few computationally intensive transactions. Our goal is:

- Allow very computationally expensive operations. The gas limit of the C-Chain is set to 8,000,000 gwei. Let's pick a number higher than that.
- Target producing one block every 10 seconds
- The same minimum transaction base fee as the C-Chain (25000000000wei = 25 gwei)
- Only slowly adjust the fee. The base fee change denominator of the C-Chain is 36.
- Have every block cost at least 500,000 gwei and at most 1,000,000 gwei
- Adjust the block gas cost same as the C-Chain (value 200000)
- When completely configured it should look something like this:

```
✔ Customize fee config
Customizing fee config
Set gas limit: 15000000
Set target block rate: 10
Set min base fee: 25000000000
Set target gas: 15000000
Set base fee change denominator: 50
Set min block gas cost: 500000
Set max block gas cost: 1000000
✔ Set block gas cost step: 200000
```

Next you will be asked if you would like the fees to be dynamic:

```
? Do you want dynamic fees on your blockchain?: 
  ▸ No, I prefer to have constant gas prices
    Yes, I would like my blockchain to have dynamic fees
    Explain the difference
```

Next you will be asked if the fees should be changeable without a network upgrade:

```
? Should transaction fees be adjustable without a network upgrade?: 
  ▸ No, use the transaction fee configuration set in the genesis block
    Yes, allow adjustment of the transaction fee configuration as needed. Recommended for production (Fee Manager Precompile ON)
    Explain the difference
```

As a last question you will be asked if the fees should be burned:

```
? Do you want the transaction fees to be burned (sent to a blackhole address)? All transaction fees on Avalanche are burned by default: 
  ▸ Yes, I want the transaction fees to be burned
    No, I want to customize accumulated transaction fees distribution (Reward Manager Precompile ON)
    Explain the difference
```
