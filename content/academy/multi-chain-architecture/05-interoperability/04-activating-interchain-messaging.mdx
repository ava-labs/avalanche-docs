Avalanche offers native interoperability between all Avalanche L1s. You will be asked if you want to connect your blockchain with other blockchains or the C-Chain. Select the first option to enable your blockchain to interoperate with other blockchains and the C-Chain. You can simply activate it by selecting `Yes`.

```
? Do you want to connect your blockchain with other blockchains or the C-Chain?: 
  â–¸ Yes, I want to enable my blockchain to interoperate with other blockchains and the C-Chain
    No, I want to run my blockchain isolated
    Explain the difference
```

This will result in the warp precompile being activated and the Interchain Messaging contracts to be deployed to your Avalanche L1. Furthermore, if you deploy it on a local network, Avalanche CLI will also run a relayer for you. You will can learn more about how the interoperability work in the course Avalanche Interchain Messaging.
