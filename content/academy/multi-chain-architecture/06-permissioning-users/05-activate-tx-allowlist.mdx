Avalanche L1s do not implement permissioning by default. To enable permissioning, you need to activate the transaction allowlist. This allows only approved addresses to issue transactions on your blockchain. Therefore, select `No` when prompted to allow anyone to issue transactions to your blockchain.

```
? Do you want to enable anyone to issue transactions to your blockchain?: 
    Yes, I want anyone to be able to issue transactions on my blockchain
  â–¸ No, I want only approved addresses to issue transactions on my blockchain (Transaction Allow List ON)
    Explain the difference
