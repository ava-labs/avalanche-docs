A **native token** in a blockchain running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) refers to the primary digital currency or cryptocurrency native to that blockchain. Native tokens act as the foundation for value transfer and network operation within their respective ecosystems.

### The Role of Native Tokens

Native tokens serve multiple key roles within EVM-based blockchain networks, such as:

- **Value Transfer**: Native tokens act as the primary currency for peer-to-peer transactions within the network, enabling value exchange between participants.
- **Gas Fees**: Native tokens are used as **gas** to pay for transaction fees, contract deployments, and other network operations. This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently within the network.
- **Security**: In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, native tokens are often used for staking to secure the network and validate transactions.
- **Governance**: In some cases, native tokens grant holders governance rights, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes that shape the blockchainâ€™s future.
