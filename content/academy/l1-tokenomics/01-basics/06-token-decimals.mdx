**Token decimals** refer to the level of precision used to define a token’s smallest unit. When a token contract is created, the number of decimals is specified to determine how divisible the token will be. This can have significant implications for user experience, application development, and overall token functionality.

For example:
- **6 decimals**: A token with 6 decimals means the smallest unit is 0.000001.
- **18 decimals**: A token with 18 decimals means the smallest unit is 0.000000000000000001.

### Why Are Token Decimals Important?

Token decimals are critical because they determine how small a fraction of the token can be used in transactions. The choice of decimals directly affects how the token is used in various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), payments, and staking.

- **Greater Precision**: More decimals allow for finer divisions of the token, which is useful in systems where very small amounts of a token need to be handled (e.g., high-frequency trading, micro-payments, or rewards distribution).
- **User Perception**: The number of decimals can also influence how users perceive the value of the token. A token with fewer decimals might appear more “whole,” making it seem like larger amounts are being used in transactions.

**Conclusion**: Token decimals are a fundamental aspect of token design. Choosing the right number of decimals depends on the token's use case, balancing the need for precision with user experience and technical requirements.
