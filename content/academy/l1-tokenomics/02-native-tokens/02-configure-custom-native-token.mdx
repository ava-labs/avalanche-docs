When creating a custom Avalanche L1 blockchain, you can configure the native token according to your specific requirements. In this section, we'll explore the steps to configure a custom native token using the Subnet-EVM, allowing you to tailor it to your blockchain's needs.



<Steps>
<Step>
### Creating the Blockchain
Start by creating a new blockchain using the `avalanche` CLI tool:
```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Select VM
You will be prompted to select the Subnet-EVM as the virtual machine for your blockchain:

```bash
? Which Virtual Machine would you like to use?: 
  ▸ Subnet-EVM
    Custom VM
    Explain the difference
```

Select Subnet-EVM to proceed.
</Step>
<Step>
### Customizing Blockchain Configuration
After selecting Subnet-EVM, you’ll have the option to use default values or customize your blockchain settings:

```bash
? Do you want to use default values for the Blockchain configuration?: 
    I want to use defaults for a test environment
    I want to use defaults for a production environment
  ▸ I don't want to use default values
    Explain the difference
```

Select **I don’t want to use default values** to manually configure your blockchain.
</Step>
<Step>
### Setting the Version, ChainID, and Token Symbol
Next, you will be asked to choose the version of Subnet-EVM and configure the ChainID and token symbol:

```bash
✔ Subnet-EVM
✔ I don't want to use default values
? Version: 
  ▸ Use latest release version
    Specify custom version
```

Choose Use latest release version for the Subnet-EVM. After that, you will configure the following:

```bash
✔ Chain ID: 123456
✔ Token Symbol: CNT
```

- **ChainID**: Choose a unique Chain ID that hasn’t been used on another blockchain. You can reference available Chain IDs by visiting [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/), which lists in-use Chain IDs.

<Accordion title="Why Avoid Chain ID Replication?">
When configuring your custom Avalanche blockchain, it’s crucial to select a unique Chain ID to avoid replication. Replicating a Chain ID that is already in use can lead to several problems, the most critical being replay attacks.

**Replay Attacks**

A replay attack occurs when a valid transaction on one blockchain can be maliciously replayed on another chain that shares the same Chain ID. For example, if two blockchains have the same Chain ID, a transaction on one chain could be copied and executed on the other, leading to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized token transfers.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
- **Token Symbol**: Set a token symbol for your custom native token (e.g., CNT). This symbol will represent your blockchain’s native token in transactions and applications.
</Step>
</Steps>

What’s Next?
After configuring the custom native token, the next step is to define the initial token allocation, where you’ll decide how the tokens will be distributed across validators, participants, and other stakeholders in your blockchain.
