### Minting Native Tokens

Once the allow list is configured, addresses with the Enabled role can mint new native tokens using the following interface:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface INativeMinter {
  event NativeCoinMinted(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="mintNativeCoin()">
This function mints a specified amount of native tokens and sends them to the designated address. Only addresses with the Enabled role can call this function.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

**Conclusion**: By enabling the Native Minter Precompile and setting up an allow list with proper roles, you can effectively manage who has permission to mint new native tokens and adjust the token supply as needed. By doing so at the **smart contract level**, Avalanche provides flexibility and security, allowing developers to control minting directly within their blockchain applications.
