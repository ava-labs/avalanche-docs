In a custom Avalanche L1 blockchain, you can opt to use an **ERC-20 token** as the native token. Typically, ERC-20 tokens serve as fungible assets within decentralized applications (dApps), but in this setup, the ERC-20 token is transferred to the new L1 via the **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)** mechanism. Once transferred, the ERC-20 token no longer behaves as a standard ERC-20 token but is instead **converted into the native token** of the new L1 blockchain.

### Features Unlocked by Using ERC-20 as Native Token

By using an ERC-20 token as the native token on a new Avalanche L1 blockchain, several unique features and benefits become available:

- **Leverage Existing Ecosystem Liquidity**

Bringing an ERC-20 token into the new L1 as a native token allows you to tap into the existing liquidity and user base of that ERC-20 token. For example, a stablecoin like USDC, transferred as an ERC-20 token, can be used as the native token to provide price stability while facilitating cross-chain transactions.

- **Interoperability with Existing dApps**

An ERC-20 token as a native token allows the new L1 to **interoperate with existing decentralized applications** (dApps) and DeFi protocols that are built around that token. This can increase user adoption by maintaining familiar token functionality across different chains.

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**

Transferring an ERC-20 token via ICTT unlocks **cross-chain compatibility**, meaning that assets and value from one blockchain ecosystem can seamlessly move and function on another blockchain. This helps promote greater liquidity across blockchains and removes barriers to token usage.

- **Gas Fee Flexibility**

Using an ERC-20 token as a native token offers flexibility in how gas fees are handled. Rather than relying on a brand-new native token, you can use the transferred ERC-20 token to **pay for gas fees**, making it easier for users already familiar with that token to interact with the new chain.

- **Governance and Staking**

Once an ERC-20 token becomes the native token on the new L1, it can be used for staking and **governance functions**, such as voting on proposals or participating in consensus mechanisms. This expands the token's utility beyond simple transactions, enabling it to play a critical role in securing and managing the new L1.

### Next Steps

In the next section, **Multi-chain Ecosystems**, we’ll explore how the transfer of assets between different chains works and how using tokens like ERC-20 as native tokens enhances cross-chain liquidity and interoperability. We’ll also look into the technical challenges and solutions involved in building robust, multi-chain ecosystems that support the seamless movement of assets like these.
