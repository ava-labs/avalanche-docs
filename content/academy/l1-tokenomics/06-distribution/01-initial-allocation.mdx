The creator of an Avalanche L1 can pre-allocate native tokens during the chain genesis event. This **initial token allocation** refers to the distribution of tokens or digital assets when a new blockchain network is launched, which is a crucial aspect of the network's design.

> **Note:** Initial token allocation determines how tokens are distributed among stakeholders and participants.

### Key Considerations for Initial Token Allocation

There are several factors to consider when allocating tokens:

#### Founders and Development Team

A portion of the initial token supply is often allocated to the founders and the development team as a reward for their efforts in creating the blockchain protocol. This serves as an incentive for continued development and network maintenance.

#### Early Investors and Backers

Another portion of the token supply may be allocated to early investors and backers who provided funding or support during the project's early stages. These entities take on early risk and are rewarded with tokens that may increase in value as the network grows.

#### Community

A significant portion of tokens may be allocated to the community through mechanisms such as token sales, airdrops, or other distribution methods. This ensures widespread ownership and participation in the network, fostering decentralization and security.

#### Reserve

Some tokens may be allocated to a reserve or treasury to fund ongoing development, marketing, and ecosystem growth initiatives. This reserve can be managed by a DAO or another entity tasked with allocating funds for the network's benefit.

> **Tip:** Transparent and equitable token allocation mechanisms are essential for fostering trust and confidence in the network among its stakeholders.
