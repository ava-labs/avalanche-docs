**Vesting schedules** are mechanisms used in blockchain projects to release tokens to team members, investors, or other stakeholders over a specified period. This approach helps align incentives, prevent immediate sell-offs, and promote long-term commitment to the project.

## Understanding Vesting Schedules

A vesting schedule dictates how and when tokens are released to a recipient. Common elements include:

- **Cliff Period**: An initial period during which no tokens are vested.
- **Vesting Period**: The total duration over which tokens are gradually released.
- **Release Interval**: The frequency at which tokens are released (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Total Allocation**: The total number of tokens to be vested.

### Types of Vesting Schedules

1. **Linear Vesting**: Tokens are released uniformly over the vesting period.
2. **Graded Vesting**: Tokens vest in portions at different intervals.
3. **Cliff Vesting**: All or a significant portion of tokens vest after the cliff period.

## Implementing Vesting Schedules in Solidity

Smart contracts can automate vesting schedules, ensuring transparency and trustlessness. Below is an example of a simple Solidity contract implementing a linear vesting schedule.

### Example Solidity Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TokenVesting {
    address public beneficiary;
    uint256 public start;
    uint256 public duration;
    uint256 public cliff;
    uint256 public totalTokens;
    uint256 public released;

    IERC20 public token;

    constructor(
        address _token,
        address _beneficiary,
        uint256 _start,
        uint256 _cliffDuration,
        uint256 _duration,
        uint256 _totalTokens
    ) {
        require(_beneficiary != address(0), "Invalid beneficiary");
        require(_cliffDuration <= _duration, "Cliff longer than duration");
        require(_duration > 0, "Duration must be > 0");

        token = IERC20(_token);
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        start = _start;
        cliff = _start + _cliffDuration;
        duration = _duration;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= cliff, "Cliff period not reached");
        uint256 unreleased = releasableAmount();
        require(unreleased > 0, "No tokens to release");

        released += unreleased;
        token.transfer(beneficiary, unreleased);
    }

    function releasableAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return vestedAmount() - released;
    }

    function vestedAmount() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp < cliff) {
            return 0;
        } else if (block.timestamp >= start + duration) {
            return totalTokens;
        } else {
            return (totalTokens * (block.timestamp - start)) / duration;
        }
    }
}

interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
