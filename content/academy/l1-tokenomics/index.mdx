Welcome to the **L1 Tokenomics** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of tokenomics, including the creation, distribution, utility, and governance of tokens within blockchain ecosystems. By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in managing tokens across multi-chain ecosystems, configuring transaction fees, and designing staking and governance models.

## Course Content

### Basics

Learn the fundamentals of tokenomics, including native tokens, ERC-20 tokens, wrapped tokens, and how token decimals affect transactions and supply.

### Native Tokens

Explore how to create custom native tokens, use Avalancheâ€™s native token minter, and integrate ERC-20 tokens as native tokens in cross-chain environments.

### Multi-Chain Ecosystems

Delve into interchain token transfers and cross-chain functionality, using both ERC-20 and native tokens across multiple blockchains.

### Staking

Understand staking tokens, liquid staking, and how to deploy staking contracts, with a focus on post-Etna upgrade features.

### Transaction Fees

Master transaction fee configuration, dynamic fee models, and learn how to distribute fees effectively within decentralized ecosystems.

### Token Distribution

Learn about initial token allocation, advanced vesting schedules, bonding curves for token pricing, and how to implement airdrops.

### Governance

Study governance models, DAOs, quadratic voting, and the latest innovations in governance (Governance 2.0) for decentralized decision-making.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

### Basic Understanding of Blockchain

This course is for people with some blockchain knowledge. Check out this [guide](/guides/what-is-a-blockchain) to review what a blockchain is.

### Avalanche

This course is intended for people with knowledge about Cross-Chain communication protocols, and a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. Avalanche Architecture: Be familiar with Avalanche blockchains.
2. Cross-Chain Messages: Know how to communicate between two Avalanche blockchains with Teleporter. 

If some of this is not clear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals, Multi-Chain Architecture, and Interchain Messaging courses first.

### Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to be able to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

1. Solidity: Basic Knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces. 
2. Foundry: Familiarity with Foundry will help to deploy and interact with contracts.
