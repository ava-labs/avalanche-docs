In this section, you will learn how to transfer an ERC-20 token from Avalanche’s C-Chain to a new Avalanche L1 using Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) and set it up to act as the **native token** on the new L1. This guide will take you through the steps of configuring a local network environment, deploying the necessary contracts, and transferring tokens.


<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a new blockchain and Deploy on Local Network

Use the **Avalanche CLI** to create a new blockchain where you will deploy the ERC-20 as the native token.


```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain  
```
For this exercise, create a Proof of Authority blockchain that has Native Minter Precompile activated. This precompile is not activated NOT with the default test values, so make sure to go through the manual configuration of your L1 with the Avalanche-CLI. Add the deployer address as the `admin`for this, for convinience we will use the ewoq key that is already loaded as part of the Starter-Kit environment variables and which public key is 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC. Go with the default values for all other steps in the configuration process.
_Note: Having the Native Minter Precompile active and the correct admin rights assigned to the deployer is crucial for the rest of this lesson._

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain
```
Add all the environment variables. You can retrieve all your L1 detailes with `avalanche blockchain describe myblockchain` and `avalanche primary describe` for C-chain details.
```bash
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN=0x...
export FUNDED_ADDRESS=0x...
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_L1=0x...
export L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX=0x...
export C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX=0x...
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on C-Chain

Use the **Avalanche CLI** to create a new blockchain where you will deploy the ERC-20 as the native token.

You will deploy an ERC-20 token on the Avalanche C-Chain, which will later be transferred and used as the native token on the new L1.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/mocks/ExampleERC20Decimals.sol:ExampleERC20Decimals --constructor-args 18
```

Save the newly created ERC20 address to the environment variables

```bash
export $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN=0x...
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Deploy Interchain Token Transfer Contracts
Set up the home and remote transferer contracts for transferring tokens between the C-Chain and the newly created L1.

- `ERC20TokenHome` Contract on C-Chain  
```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenHome/ERC20TokenHome.sol:ERC20TokenHome --constructor-args $TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN $FUNDED_ADDRESS $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN 18
```

Export to environment variables:

```bash
export ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN=0x...
``` 

- `NativeTokenRemote` Contract on `myblockchain` 
```bash 
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenRemote/NativeTokenRemote.sol:NativeTokenRemote --constructor-args "($TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_L1, $FUNDED_ADDRESS, $C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX, $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN, 18)" "EXMP.b" 100000000000000000000 0 false 0
```

Add to the enviroment variables 

```bash
export NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1=0x...
```

_Note: When deploying the `NativeTokenRemote` contract on the L1, ensure that the **initial amount** matches the native token amount that was minted when the blockchain was created. This ensures consistency between the native token supply and the remote token counterpart._

</Step>
<Step>
### Granting Native Minting Rights to NativeTokenRemote Contract
To ensure that the `NativeTokenRemote` contract can mint native tokens on the L1 when ERC-20 tokens are transferred from the `C-Chain`, the contract must be granted **minting rights**. This is done by adding the `NativeTokenRemote contract` address to the `Native Minter Precompile`.

1. You will need to interact with the `Native Minter Precompile`, which resides at a fixed address on all Avalanche L1s:  
**Native Minter Precompile Address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`
     
2. Use the following command to grant the `NativeTokenRemote` contract minting rights by setting it as an **enabled** address on the Native Minter Precompile:
  
```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001 "setEnabled(address)" $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1
```
Once this step is completed, the `NativeTokenRemote` contract will have the necessary permissions to mint native tokens when ERC-20 tokens are transferred from the C-Chain.
</Step>
<Step>
### Register Remote Token with Home Transferer
Register the remote token on the home chain so that it recognizes the transferer contracts.

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 "registerWithHome((address, uint256))" "(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0)"
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Collateralize and Transfer Tokens
Add collateral to the transferer contract on the home chain, and then send the ERC-20 tokens across chains.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is Collateral?">
Collateral in this context refers to the amount of the token that is locked in the `Home Transferer contract` on the source chain (`C-Chain`) to back the value of the token on the destination chain (`myblockchain`). This ensures that for every token minted on the remote chain, there’s an equivalent token locked as collateral on the home chain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is Collateral Important?">
Collateralization ensures that the total supply of the token remains consistent across both chains. When tokens are sent from the `home chain`, they are locked as collateral, and a corresponding number of tokens is minted on the remote chain. If tokens are sent back to the home chain, the collateral is unlocked, and the minted tokens on the remote chain are burned.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

- **Approve Tokens for Transfer**  
Approve a certain number of tokens to be used by the Home Transferer. 

```bash  
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN "approve(address, uint256)" $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN 2000000000000000000000
```

- **Add Collateral and Send Tokens**  
Add collateral to the transferer contract.
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN "addCollateral(bytes32, address, uint256)" $L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 100000000000000000000
```
Send tokens to the L1
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN "send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address), uint256)" "(${L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)" 1000000000000000000000
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Conclusion

Follow the steps above to transfer an ERC-20 token from the C-Chain to your custom Avalanche L1 and use it as the native token. This exercise will demonstrate how Avalanche’s **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)** system works, ensuring that tokens are properly locked, transferred, and minted across multiple chains.

For more detailed information, refer to the [official Avalanche ICTT documentation](/academy/interchain-token-transfer).
