**Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT)** allow assets, such as ERC-20 or native tokens, to move seamlessly between different Avalanche L1 blockchains. The system consists of a **TokenHome** contract, which lives on the source blockchain, and **TokenRemote** contracts, which reside on other Avalanche L1s that want to receive the asset.

### Overview of How It Works

- **Home and Remote Contracts**:

The `TokenHome` contract manages the transfer of assets from the source Avalanche L1 blockchain. It locks the original asset as collateral and tracks token balances sent to `TokenRemote` contracts on other L1s.

The `TokenRemote` contracts, on the receiving chains, mint a representation of the original token, allowing users to interact with it as if it were the native token of that chain.

- **Transfer Process**:

When a user transfers an asset from the `source chain` to a `remote chain`, the asset is **locked** on the `home chain`, and a corresponding representation of the token is **minted** on the `remote chain`.

This setup allows for different configurations, where the token can be represented as either an **ERC-20 token** or a **native token** on both the home and remote chains, giving flexibility to developers.

- **Cross-Chain Flexibility**:

Assets can be transferred in multiple configurations:
- `ERC-20` -> `ERC-20`
- `ERC-20` -> `Native`
- `Native` -> `ERC-20`
- `Native` -> `Native`

This flexibility allows developers to choose how assets are represented and used across multiple Avalanche L1s.

Configurations of the `TokenHome` and `TokenRemote` contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src)

- **Permissionless Registration**:

ICTT is designed to be permissionless. Anyone can register a compatible `TokenRemote` instance to a `TokenHome` contract, expanding the network of chains that can receive transferred tokens.

- **Customizable Logic**:

Developers can extend the default `ERC20TokenRemote` contract to implement custom minting, burning, or transfer logic, giving them flexibility to add functionality specific to their use cases.
