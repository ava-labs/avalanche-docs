In this section, you will learn how to transfer a native token from Avalanche’s C-Chain to a new Avalanche L1 using Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) and set it up to act as the **native token** on the new L1. This guide will walk you through each step, from creating a L1 to transferring and using the native token.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a new blockchain and Deploy on Local Network

Use the `avalanche` CLI to create a new blockchain where you will deploy the ERC-20 as the native token.


```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain  
```
```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain
```

Take note of the important addresses (e.g., `Teleporter Registry`, `Funded Address`) from the deployment output as they will be needed in the following steps.
</Step>
<Step>
### Wrap the Native Token on C-Chain

You'll need to deploy a wrapped token contract for your native token on the C-Chain. The wrapped token will serve as the transferable asset between the chains.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol:WrappedNativeToken
```

After deployment, save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable for future use.

```bash
export WRAPPED_NATIVE_C_CHAIN=<address>
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Deploy Interchain Token Transfer Contracts

Now, deploy the Interchain Token Transfer contracts on both the `C-Chain` and the `myblockchain` to enable cross-chain token transfers.

- `NativeTokenHome` Contract on C-Chain  

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenHome/NativeTokenHome.sol:NativeTokenHome --constructor-args $TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN $FUNDED_ADDRESS $WRAPPED_NATIVE_C_CHAIN
```

- `NativeTokenRemote` Contract on `myblockchain`

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenRemote/NativeTokenRemote.sol:NativeTokenRemote --constructor-args "(${TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_L1}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${NATIVE_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN})" "NATV" 700000000000000000000 0 false 0
```

_Note: Ensure that the initial amount matches the native token amount minted on the C-Chain during the wrapped token deployment._

Export the deployed addresses as environment variables:

```
export NATIVE_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN=<"Deployed to" address>
export NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1=<"Deployed to" address>
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Grant Native Minting Rights to NativeTokenRemote

To ensure that the `NativeTokenRemote` contract can mint native tokens on the L1 when ERC-20 tokens are transferred from the `C-Chain`, the contract must be granted **minting rights**. This is done by adding the `NativeTokenRemote` contract address to the `Native Minter Precompile`.

1. You will need to interact with the `Native Minter Precompile`, which resides at a fixed address on all Avalanche L1s:  
**Native Minter Precompile Address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`
     
2. Use the following command to grant the `NativeTokenRemote` contract minting rights by setting it as an **enabled** address on the Native Minter Precompile:
  
```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001 "setEnabled(address)" $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1
```

- `$NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1`: The deployed address of the `NativeTokenRemote` contract on your L1.

Once this step is completed, the `NativeTokenRemote` contract will have the necessary permissions to mint native tokens when ERC-20 tokens are transferred from the C-Chain.
</Step>
<Step>
### Register Remote Token with Home Transferer
Register the remote token on the home chain so that it recognizes the transferer contracts.

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 "registerWithHome((address, uint256))" "(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0)"
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Collateralize and Transfer Tokens
Collateralize the home contract by locking native tokens. The amount of collateral should match the initial token reserve set on the `myblockchain`.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is Collateral?">
Collateral in this context refers to the amount of the token that is locked in the `Home Transferer contract` on the source chain (`C-Chain`) to back the value of the token on the destination chain (`myblockchain`). This ensures that for every token minted on the remote chain, there’s an equivalent token locked as collateral on the home chain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is Collateral Important?">
Collateralization ensures that the total supply of the token remains consistent across both chains. When tokens are sent from the `home chain`, they are locked as collateral, and a corresponding number of tokens is minted on the remote chain. If tokens are sent back to the home chain, the collateral is unlocked, and the minted tokens on the remote chain are burned.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

- **Approve Tokens for Transfer**  
Approve a certain number of tokens to be used by the Home Transferer. 

```bash  
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN "approve(address, uint256)" $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN 2000000000000000000000
```

- **Add Collateral and Send Tokens**  
Add collateral to the transferer contract.
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN "addCollateral(bytes32, address, uint256)" $L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 100000000000000000000
```
Send tokens to the L1.
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN "send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address), uint256)" "(${L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)" 1000000000000000000000
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Check Balances

Finally, check the balance on the L1 to confirm that the tokens were successfully transferred and minted.

```bash
cast balance --rpc-url myblockchain $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```

You can also verify that the token is collateralized:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 "isCollateralized()(bool)"
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ll successfully transfer a native token from the C-Chain to a L1 and use it as the native token via Avalanche’s Interchain Token Transfer system.
