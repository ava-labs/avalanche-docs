### Setting a Custom Fee Recipient​

By default, all fees are burned (sent to the black hole address with `"allowFeeRecipients": false`). However, it is possible to enable block producers to set a fee recipient (who will get compensated for blocks they produce).

To enable this feature, you'll need to add the following to your genesis file (under the "config" key):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "allowFeeRecipients": true
  }
}
```

### Fee Recipient Address​
With `allowFeeRecipients` enabled, your validators can specify their addresses to collect fees. They need to update their EVM chain config with the following to specify where the fee should be sent to.

```json
{
  "feeRecipient": "<YOUR 0x-ADDRESS>"
}
```
<Callout>
If `allowFeeRecipients` feature is enabled on the Avalanche L1, but a validator doesn't specify a `feeRecipient`, the fees will be burned in blocks it produces.
</Callout>
This mechanism can be also activated as a precompile. See [Changing Fee Reward Mechanisms](https://build.avax.network/docs/avalanche-l1s/upgrade/customize-avalanche-l1#changing-fee-reward-mechanisms) in Avalanche docs for more details
