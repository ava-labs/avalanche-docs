We can take this concept even further: The same network of validators can run two or more blockchains. These could operate different VMs, like a soda dispenser and a candy dispenser, or identical VMs, like two soda dispensers. When a user wants to issue an operation, they specify which blockchain to interact with.

You can think of a Virtual Machine (VM) as a blueprint for a blockchain, where the same VM can create multiple blockchains, each adhering to the same rules but remaining logically independent from the others. 

Even though two blockchains may use the same virtual machine, they each have an independent state. As an example, it could be the case that in one soda dispenser, a user has a credit of 1 dollar to their name while in the other soda dispenser, they do not have any credits to their name.

The number of blockchains a validator can validate is primarily limited by the additional computational resources required to operate the virtual machines of all the chains.
