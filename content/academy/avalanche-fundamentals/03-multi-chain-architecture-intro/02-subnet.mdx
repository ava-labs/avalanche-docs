An Avalanche L1 is a network with its own set of rules regarding membership, token economics, and execution layer. It is composed of a Subset of Avalanche validators collaborating to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Validators can be members of numerous Avalanche L1s.

Avalanche enables multiple interconnected Avalanche L1s. Each Avalanche L1 is independent while maintaining the capacity to communicate with other Avalanche L1s. All validators are part of the Avalanche L1 known as the Primary Network.

Each blockchain belongs to exactly one Avalanche L1, but an Avalanche L1 can validate many blockchains. Each blockchain can define its own Virtual Machine (EVM, customized EVM or entirely new VM). 

The tailored, application-specific blockchains of Avalanche L1s offer a solution to these challenges and many others, moving away from the monolithic blockchain structure of the past.
