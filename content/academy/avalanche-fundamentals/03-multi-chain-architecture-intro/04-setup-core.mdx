To grasp the concept of the Avalanche L1s better, interact with some chains. To do that, we will use Core. Core is an all-in-one command center built for multi-chain systems. It supports Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all EVM-compatible blockchains. Core has a browser extension, a web wallet, and a mobile app. It is optimized for multiple chains and makes navigating between them easy.

## Managing MetaMask & Core Extensions

If you've added both Metamask and Core Wallet to your browser, you could face some problems. But, to fix them, you don't need to remove Metamask. Just follow the below steps to disable the Metamask extension:

Open the extensions page in browser. You can also type chrome://extensions in your address bar to open extensions page.
Scroll through your list of installed extensions, or use the search bar at the top of the page, to find the Metamask extension.
Once you find Metamask, you will see a toggle switch next to it. Click on this switch to disable the extension.

When the switch is in the off position, Metamask is disabled, and you should be all set.
