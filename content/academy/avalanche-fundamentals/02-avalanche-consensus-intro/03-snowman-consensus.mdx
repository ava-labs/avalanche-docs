Protocols in the Avalanche family operate through repeated sub-sampled voting. When a validator is determining whether a block should be accepted, it asks a small, random subset of validators on their preferences. Based on the responses the validator gets, it might change its own preference.

Let's visualize this with an example. You are a validator in a set of validators that is performing the Avalanche Consensus protocol to agree on whether to send the funds to Charlie (yellow) or to Bob (blue). It is important to understand that none of the validators really cares whether it is going to be yellow or blue, as long as all correctly operating validators decide for the same outcome at the end of the process. The starting preference is chosen random by each validator.

## Changing Preference

You start by sampling the current preference of five other nodes and they reply: 2 prefer yellow (Charlie) and 3 prefer blue (Bob).

Avalanche consensus dictates, that a validator changes its preference if a α-majority of the sampled validators agrees on another option and it goes along with this popular choice. 

Let's set the alpha value to 3 in our example, meaning that we change our preference when 3 out of 5 sampled nodes have another preference. Since 3 out of 5 have replied with blue (Bob) we are changing our own preference to Bob.

From now on you will respond with blue, when another validators queries you for your current preference.

## Consecutive Successes

Avalanche Consensus does not run for a fixed number of rounds, but until a decision threshold is hit. This means the validator keep sampling until their preference is confirmed for beta (β) consecutive rounds.

Now you query another five validators for their preference. Again, three of the five reply with the preference blue (Bob). Since your current preference is confirmed, you increment a counter for consecutive successes by one. You repeat this sampling process until their preference is confirmed for 8 consecutive rounds.

## Parameters of Avalanche Consensus

In our example we used fixed values for how many nodes are sampled, how many are needed to change our preference and how many consecutive rounds of successes we require to finalize our decision. These consensus parameters are formalized in the table below and can be chosen by every node individually to meet their needs.

|Symbol|Name|Range|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|n  |Number of Participants|1 to ∞|How many participants take part in the system?|
|k  |Sample Size|1 to n|How many of these participants get asked every round of sub-sampling?|
|α  |Quorum Size|1 to k|How many of the asked participants have to have the same preference for me to change my preference?|
|β  |Decision Threshold|>= 1|How many times does the quorum have to confirm my preference until I finalize my decision?|

With these parameters we can illustrate the consensus algorithm as pseudo code:

## Finalization

In the common case when a transaction has no conflicts, finalization happens very quickly. When conflicts exist, honest validators quickly cluster around conflicting transactions, entering a positive feedback loop until all correct validators prefer that transaction. This leads to the acceptance of non-conflicting transactions and the rejection of conflicting transactions.

Avalanche Consensus guarantees (with high probability based on system parameters) that if any honest validator accepts a transaction, all honest validators will come to the same conclusion.
