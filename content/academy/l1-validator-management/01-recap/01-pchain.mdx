## Platform Chain

The Platform Chain (P-Chain) is the "root" of the Avalanche network. It is a registry of all validators in the Avalanche network (Primary, Subnets, L1s).

This chain can create new subnets and later convert them into L1s. It is also responsible for managing the validator set.
There is no smart contract platform on the P-Chain, it is a simple registry of validators and subnets.

## Validators

Validators are the nodes that are responsible for validating a blockchain (Primary, Subnet, or L1). They are responsible for proposing new blocks and validating the state of the network.
All validators are registered on the P-Chain with a unique node ID, public key, and weight, mapped to the blockchain they are validating.

## Subnets

Subnets are a way to partition the Avalanche network. They are a way to group together Avalanche Primary Network validators to form new blockchains.
Each Primary Network validator can be a member of multiple subnets, and each subnet can have multiple validators.

Each subnet validator stakes `2,000 AVAX` on the P-Chain.

## L1s

L1s are sovereign validators that are registered on the P-Chain. They are not a part of the Avalanche Primary Network.
L1s are created by converting a subnet on the P-Chain to an L1 with the `ConvertSubnetToL1` function.

Each validator of an L1 pays a `1.33 AVAX` monthly fee to register on the P-Chain.
