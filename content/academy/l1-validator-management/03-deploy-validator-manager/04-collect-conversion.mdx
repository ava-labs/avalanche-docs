import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import CollectConversionSignatures from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/L1/CollectConversionSignatures.tsx"

Now that the `ValidatorManager` contract has been deployed and initialized, we can collect the signatures for the `convertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction.

Specifically, we will collect the signatures for a `SubnetToL1ConversionMessage` that was emitted from the P-Chain after the `convertSubnetToL1Tx` from earlier was confirmed.

We will later use this signed warp message to initialize the validator set on the P-Chain in the next step.
