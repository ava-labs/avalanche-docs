import UpgradeProxy from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/ValidatorManager/UpgradeProxy.tsx"

Now that you've deployed the `ValidatorManager` contract, you need to upgrade the proxy. The proxy is registered on the P-Chain as the `ValidatorManager` contract, and you'll update it to point to your new implementation.

<Callout type="info">
    If you created your L1 using the Genesis Builder from this course, the `Manager Address` is an OpenZeppelin [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) that was pre-deployed in your `genesis.json` file.
