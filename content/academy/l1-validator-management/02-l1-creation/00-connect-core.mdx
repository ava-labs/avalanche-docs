## Prerequisites

<Callout type="info">
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Core wallet](https://core.app/) installed on your device
- Some AVAX tokens:
  - For mainnet: Purchase AVAX from supported exchanges
  - For Fuji testnet: Get test tokens from the [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/)
</Callout>

## Understanding Avalanche Addresses

When working with Avalanche, it's important to understand that each chain in the network uses a different address format. Your wallet will have three different addresses - one for each chain (P-Chain, X-Chain, and C-Chain).

### Chain Address Formats

  <div className="flex">
    <div className="relative flex flex-col border-2 border-black px-8 py-10">
      <div className="absolute -top-8 left-0 right-0 text-xl font-bold text-center">Avalanche Wallet</div>
      
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4 mb-8">
        <div className="font-bold">X-Chain</div>
        <div>X-fujixx...</div>
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4 mb-8">
        <div className="font-bold">P-Chain</div>
        <div>P-fujixx...</div>
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
        <div className="font-bold">C-Chain</div>
        <div>0x1231...</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  While each chain has its own address format, all addresses in your wallet are derived from the same private key. This means you only need to secure one private key or seed phrase to protect all your chain addresses.
</Callout>

### P-Chain Address Format

The P-Chain (Platform Chain) uses the [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) address format, which follows the [BIP-0173](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173) standard. This format was chosen for its error detection capabilities and human-readable features.

A P-Chain address consists of four parts:
1. Chain prefix: `P-`
2. Network identifier (HRP - Human-Readable Part):
   - `avax` for mainnet
   - `fuji` for testnet
3. Separator: `1`
4. Base32-encoded payload + 6-character error correction code

Examples:
```
Mainnet: P-avax1kj06lhgx84h39snsljcey3tpc046ze68mek3g5
Testnet: P-fuji1n3axecsjsrfxrgcadsd0km0kgcheuxw4t53886
```

### X-Chain Address Format

The X-Chain (Exchange Chain) also uses the Bech32 format but with an `X-` prefix. The rest of the format follows the same structure as P-Chain addresses.

### C-Chain Address Format

The C-Chain (Contract Chain) uses the Ethereum hex format since it's EVM-compatible. These addresses:
- Start with `0x`
- Contain 40 hexadecimal characters
- Are compatible with all Ethereum tools and standards

Example: `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`
