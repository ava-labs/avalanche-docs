## Creating a Blockchain on Avalanche

Now that you have successfully created a `subnetID` and generated a `genesis.json` file, the next step is to create the blockchain.

### Understanding the CreateChainTx Transaction

The `CreateChainTx` transaction is a critical operation on the P-Chain that:

- Establishes a new blockchain and associates it with your previously created `subnetID`
- Uploads your `genesis.json` configuration to the network
- Generates a unique `blockchainID` that permanently identifies your chain within the Avalanche ecosystem

### Virtual Machine (VM) Configuration

When creating your blockchain, you'll need to specify the appropriate Virtual Machine:

- For standard `subnet-evm` chains, use the default VM ID: `srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy`
- If you're deploying a custom VM (such as `subnet-evm` with custom precompiles or a `hypersdk`-based chain), you must specify the correct custom VM ID

### Creating Your Blockchain

Use the interactive tool below to complete the blockchain creation process:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <CreateChain />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

### Next Steps After Blockchain Creation

Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, your blockchain will be live on the P-Chain. You can:

1. **Quick Start**: Launch an `avalanchego` node in Docker and connect to your chain using the [L1 Toolbox](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox#avalanchegoDocker)

2. **Advanced Deployment**: For a more hands-on approach with detailed configuration options, refer to the [Node & Validator](/docs/nodes) documentation

### Monitoring and Management

After creation, your blockchain will be visible in explorers and can be managed through standard Avalanche APIs and tools. You'll use the `blockchainID` for all future operations involving your chain.
