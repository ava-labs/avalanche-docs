### Creating Your First Subnet

After connecting your wallet to the P-Chain, you're ready to create your own subnet. Here's what happens during subnet creation:

1. You submit a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction to the P-Chain
2. The P-Chain creates a unique `subnetID` by hashing your wallet address
3. This `subnetID` becomes your subnet's permanent identifier

The `subnetID` is crucial for future operations - you'll need it when:
- Creating blockchains within your subnet
- Adding validators to your subnet
- Managing subnet permissions
- Converting the subnet to an L1 (permissioned or permissionless)

There's no limit to how many subnets you can create from a single wallet address.
