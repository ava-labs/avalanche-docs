After creating a blockchain, it doesn't have any validators and cannot process transactions. At this point, you need to decide how to deploy your validators:

1. **Convert the Subnet to an L1** - Start with a new validator set with lower barrier to entry (1.33 `AVAX` / month per validator)
2. **Stay a Subnet** - Add validators with traditional staking requirements (2,000 `AVAX` per validator)

<Callout type="info">
For a detailed comparison between L1s and Subnets, read about the [Etna Upgrade](/academy/avalanche-fundamentals/03-multi-chain-architecture-intro/03a-etna-upgrade).

## The Conversion Process

Converting a Subnet to an L1 requires executing a `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction on the P-Chain. This transaction establishes a new validator set for your blockchain and transforms it from a Subnet into a sovereign L1 chain. The `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction is a one-time transaction that can only be executed once by the Subnet owner(s).

### Key Parameters

The conversion transaction requires several important parameters:

- **Subnet ID** - The unique identifier of your Subnet
- **Blockchain ID** - The ID of the blockchain where the Validator Manager contract will be deployed
- **Node Information** - Details for each validator initial validator in your new L1
- **Validator Weights** - The relative weight of each validator in the consensus (determines voting power)
- **Validator Balances** - Initial AVAX balance for each validator (in nAVAX, where `1,000,000,000 nAVAX = 1 AVAX`)
- **Validator Manager Address** - The address of the contract that will manage validators for your L1

<Callout type="info">
The **Validator Manager Address** is initially set to an OpenZeppelin [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) contract pre-deployed in the `genesis.json`. After conversion, you'll deploy the actual `ValidatorManager` implementation contract and update the proxy to point to it.

## Conversion Tool

Use the following tool to convert your Subnet to an L1:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <ConvertToL1 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

## Important Considerations

<Callout type="warn">
If converting a pre-existing Subnet with validators, you must establish a completely new validator set for the L1 conversion. The existing Subnet validators cannot be automatically transferred.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
Initially, validators are managed through Proof-of-Authority (PoA) using the `ValidatorManager` contract with a designated admin controlling validator membership. Later, you can upgrade to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) by transferring ownership to a `StakingManager` contract that enables:

- Permissionless validators staking with the L1's native token via `NativeTokenStakingManager`
- Validators staking using an ERC20 token via `ERC20TokenStakingManager` 
- Support for delegators to stake with validators and earn rewards
- Configurable uptime-based validation rewards
- Customizable minimum stake durations and churn limits

The `StakingManager` contracts follow the [ACP-99 standard](https://github.com/ava-labs/icm-contracts/tree/main/contracts/validator-manager) for validator management functionality.
