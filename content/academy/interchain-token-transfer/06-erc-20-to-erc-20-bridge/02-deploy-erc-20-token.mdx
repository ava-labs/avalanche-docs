### Deploy an ERC-20 Token

To transfer an ERC20 token from C-chain to your own blockchain, the first thing we will need is the ERC20 token to bridge. You will find a contract in the Starter-Kit under `contracts/interchain-token-transfer/MyToken.sol:TOK` 

```bash 
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-token-transfer/MyToken.sol:TOK
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the ERC-20 Address 

```bash
export ERC20_C_CHAIN=<"Deployed to" address>
```

</Step>

### Check the Balance

If you deployed the above example contract, you should see a balance of 100,000 tokens when you run the below command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_C_CHAIN "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```
