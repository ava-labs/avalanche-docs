In this section, you’ll learn how to deploy your own **ICTT frontend** using the BuilderKit and pre-configured tokens and chains. Follow these steps to quickly set up and test your own ICTT frontends with Avalanche L1s.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Open the AvaCloudSDK Starter Kit Github Repository

Start by opening the repository on Github.

<Link
    href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Avalanche Starter Kit</Link>
</Step>

<Step>
### Open the Dev Container and Navigate to the Chain Definitions

- Open the repository in a Github Codespace or Visual Studio Code.
- Navigate to the `web-apps/builderkit/chains/definitions` folder.

In this folder, you’ll find separate files for each chain configuration. For example, `echo.ts` contains the definition for the **Echo L1** chain:

```ts
import { defineChain } from "viem";

export const echo = defineChain({
    id: 173750,
    name: 'Echo L1',
    network: 'echo',
    nativeCurrency: {
        decimals: 18,
        name: 'Ech',
        symbol: 'ECH',
    },
    rpcUrls: {
        default: {
            http: ['https://subnets.avax.network/echo/testnet/rpc']
        },
    },
    blockExplorers: {
        default: { name: 'Explorer', url: 'https://subnets-test.avax.network/echo' },
    },
    iconUrl: "/chains/logo/173750.png"
});
```

### How to Configure Your Own Blockchain

To configure your custom blockchain (e.g., `myblockchain`):

1. Copy the existing echo.ts file and rename it to myblockchain.ts.
2. Update the fields to match your blockchain’s specific details, such as chain ID, network name, and native currency.
3. Save the file in the chains/definitions folder. 

</Step>
<Step> 
### Import Your Chains

- Navigate to the `web-apps/builderkit/flows/ictt` folder.

Once you're inside the **ICTT** folder, open the `page.tsx` file to begin configuring the tokens and chains.

```tsx
import { myblockchain } from './chains/definitions';
```

**Add Imported Chains to Array**

After importing the chains, add them into the chains array:

```tsx
const chains = [avalanche, avalancheFuji, echo, dispatch, myblockchain];
```

This array will hold the configuration of all the chains that will interact with your ICTT frontend.
</Step>
<Step> 
### Add Your Chain, and Configure Tokens

Next, configure your tokens. Here’s an example token configuration:

```tsx
const tokens = [
  {
    address: "0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d",
    name: "TOK",
    symbol: "TOK",
    decimals: 18,
    chain_id: 43113,
    supports_ictt: true,
    transferer: "0xD63c60859e6648b20c38092cCceb92c5751E32fF",
    mirrors: [
      {
        address: "0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d",
        transferer: "0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d",
        chain_id: 173750,
        decimals: 18
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    address: "0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d",
    name: "TOK.e",
    symbol: "TOK.e",
    decimals: 18,
    chain_id: 173750,
    supports_ictt: true,
    is_transferer: true,
    mirrors: [
      {
        home: true,
        address: "0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d",
        transferer: "0xD63c60859e6648b20c38092cCceb92c5751E32fF",
        chain_id: 43113,
        decimals: 18
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What Are `is_transferer` and `home` Flags?">
- **`is_transferer` Flag**: This flag is used to indicate if the token on the current chain is a transferer. A transferer is a contract that allows the token to be moved between chains using Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT). Set this flag to true if this token is responsible for transferring assets.
- **`home` Flag**: The `home` flag is used to indicate that this token is the original version of the asset on the **home chain**. When a token is mirrored on multiple chains, the home chain holds the original token, while the mirrors are representations of it on other chains.

These flags ensure proper handling of tokens when they are moved across chains. The `home` flag helps identify which chain holds the token, while `the is_transferer` flag specifies whether the token contract is responsible for transfers. 
</Accordion>
</Accordions>


</Step>
<Step> 
### Implement the ICTT Component

After configuring the tokens and chains, implement the **ICTT component** in the page. Here’s how to pass the token and chain details to the component:

```tsx
<ICTT tokens={tokens} token_in="0x8D6f0E153B1D4Efb46c510278Db3678Bb1Cc823d" source_chain_id={43113} destination_chain_id={173750}></ICTT>
```

In this example:

- `tokens` contains the configuration.
- `token_in` specifies the address of the token being transferred.
- `source_chain_id` and `destination_chain_id` represent the IDs of the source and destination chains. 
</Step>
<Step> 
### Run the Application

Move back to the `web-apps` folder and run the following command to start the app in development mode:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

You can now interact with the ICTT component.
