## Transfer an ERC-20 Token &rarr; Avalanche L1 as an ERC-20 Token

This chapter will show you how to send an ERC-20 Token on C-Chain to an Avalanche L1 using Interchain Messaging and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network, but can be applied to Fuji Testnet and Avalanche Mainnet directly.

**All Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer contracts and interfaces implemented in this chapter implementation are maintained in the [`avalanche-interchain-token-transfer`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The avalanche-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we will do

1. Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on C-Chain
2. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on C-Chain and Avalanche L1
3. Register Remote Token contract with the Home Transferer contract
4. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens
