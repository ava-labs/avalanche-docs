## Integrate Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) Into Core

ICTT bridges deployed through [**AvaCloud**](https://avacloud.io/) will automatically integrate into the [**Core Bridge**](https://core.app/en/bridge). This ensures that any bridges created through AvaCloud are available immediately and do not need extra review.

However, **ICTT bridges** deployed outside of AvaCloud (by third-party developers or other methods) will need to be submitted for manual review. Developers will need to provide:

1. **Token Bridge Contract Address(es)**: The bridge contract(s) on the L1.
2. **Layer 1 Information**: Name and other key details of the associated L1 blockchain.

The Core team will review this info to ensure the bridge meets security and compliance standards. This guarantees network reliability while allowing more flexibility.

### AvaCloud Relayer Service and Bridge Integration

When deploying ICTT bridges, the **meta-transaction relayer** plays a key role in enhancing the user experience. Once the bridge is set up, the relayer ensures users can transfer assets between chains without worrying about gas fees. 

By using the **relayer service**, gas costs for transactions made through the bridge are handled on behalf of users, streamlining cross-chain operations. The relayer, funded with the L1's gas token, forwards transactions signed by users to the destination chain, ensuring the asset bridge between chains works smoothly without requiring users to hold or manage gas tokens.

This integration is especially useful for bridging clients who are not familiar with Web3, as it removes the need for them to manage gas tokens during the cross-chain asset transfer process. Once set up, the relayer infrastructure includes:

1. A **relaying node** to handle transactions.
2. A **relayer wallet** funded with gas tokens from the L1.
3. A **trusted forwarder contract** that securely relays transactions.

With this setup, users benefit from a gas-free experience when interacting with your bridge, making cross-chain transfers and other actions seamless and accessible.
