## `TokenHome`

An abstract implementation of `ITokenTransferrer` for a token transfer contract on the "home" chain with the asset to be transferred. Each `TokenHome` instance supports transferring exactly one token type (ERC20 or native) on its chain to arbitrarily many "remote" instances on other chains.

It handles locking tokens to be sent to `TokenRemote` instances, as well as receiving token transfer messages to either redeem tokens it holds as collateral (i.e. unlock) or route them to other `TokenRemote` instances (i.e. "multi-hop").

In the case of a multi-hop transfer, the `TokenHome` already has the collateral locked from when the tokens were originally transferred to the first `TokenRemote` instance, so it simply updates the accounting of the transferred balances to each respective `TokenRemote` instance.

Remote contracts must first be registered with a `TokenHome` instance before the home contract will allow for sending tokens to them. This is to prevent tokens from being transferred to invalid remote addresses.

Anyone is able to deploy and register remote contracts, which may have been modified from this repository. It is the responsibility of the users of the home contract to independently evaluate each remote for its security and correctness.

### `ERC20TokenHome`

A concrete implementation of `TokenHome` and `IERC20TokenTransferrer` that handles the locking and releasing of an ERC20 token.

### `NativeTokenHome`

A concrete implementation of `TokenHome` and `INativeTokenTransferrer` that handles the locking and release of the native EVM asset.
