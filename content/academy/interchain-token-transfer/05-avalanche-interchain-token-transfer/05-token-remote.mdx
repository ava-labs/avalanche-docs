## `TokenRemote`

An abstract implementation of `ITokenTransferrer` for a token transfer contract on a "remote" chain that receives transferred assets from a specific `TokenHome` instance. Each `TokenRemote` instance has a single `TokenHome` instance that it receives token transfers from to mint tokens. It also handles sending messages (and correspondingly burning tokens) to route tokens back to other chains (either its `TokenHome`, or other `TokenRemote` instances).

Once deployed, a `TokenRemote` instance must be registered with its specified `TokenHome` contract. This is done by calling `registerWithHome` on the remote contract, which will send a Interchain Messaging message to the home contract with the information to register.

All messages sent by `TokenRemote` instances are sent to the specified `TokenHome` contract, whether they are to redeem the collateral from the `TokenHome` instance or route the tokens to another `TokenRemote` instance.

Routing tokens from one `TokenRemote` instance to another is referred to as a "multi-hop", where the tokens are first sent back to their `TokenHome` contract to update its accounting, and then automatically routed on to their intended destination `TokenRemote` instance.

TokenRemote contracts allow for scaling token amounts, which should be used when the remote asset has a higher or lower denomination than the home asset, such as allowing for a ERC20 home asset with a denomination of 6 to be used as the native EVM asset on a remote chain (with a denomination of 18).

### `ERC20TokenRemote`

A concrete implementation of `TokenRemote`, `IERC20TokenTransferrer`, and `IERC20` that handles the minting and burning of an ERC20 asset. Note that the `ERC20TokenRemote` contract is an ERC20 implementation itself, which is why it takes the `tokenName`, `tokenSymbol`, and `tokenDecimals` in its constructor.

All of the ERC20 interface implementations are inherited from the standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation and can be overridden in other implementations if desired.

### `NativeTokenRemote`

A concrete implementation of `TokenRemote`, `INativeTokenTransferrer`, and `IWrappedNativeToken` that handles the minting and burning of the native EVM asset on its chain using the native minter precompile.

Deployments of this contract must be permitted to mint native coins in the chain's configuration. Note that the `NativeTokenRemote` is also an implementation of `IWrappedNativeToken` itself, which is why the `nativeAssetSymbol` must be provided in its constructor.

`NativeTokenRemote` instances always have a denomination of 18, which is the denomination of the native asset of EVM chains. We will cover Native Token Remote in depth later in the course.
