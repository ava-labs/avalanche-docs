ICTT is also capable of bridging native tokens from Avalanche L1s to the C-Chain as ERC-20 tokens. This process involves deploying a `NativeTokenHome` contract on the Avalanche L1, and a `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the C-Chain. The `NativeTokenHome` contract will be used to bridge the native token to the C-Chain as an ERC-20 token.

This example will cover native to ERC-20 token bridging between `myblockchain` and the C-Chain, but the process can be adapted to bridge the C-Chain's native asset, `AVAX`, to any L1 as an ERC-20 token.

### What we will do
1. Deploy a Wrapped Native Token to `myblockchain`
2. Deploy the `NativeTokenHome` contract on `myblockchain`
3. Deploy the `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the C-Chain
4. Register `ERC20TokenRemote` on C-Chain with `NativeTokenHome` on `myblockchain`
4. Perform a transfer of the native token on `myblockchain` to the C-Chain as an ERC-20 token
