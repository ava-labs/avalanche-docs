### Transfer the Token Cross-chain with a Multi-hop Transfer

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed and configured, send the ERC-20 token from `myblockchain` to `myblockchain2` with the [`cast send`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) foundry command.

The token will be routed through the Avalanche C-Chain and then to `myblockchain2`.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 \
"send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address), uint256)" \
"(${SOURCE_BLOCKCHAIN2_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_CHAIN2}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0, 250000, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS})" 500000000000000
```

### Check Balance

To confirm the token was bridged from `myblockchain1` to `myblockchain2` via the C-Chain, we will check the recipient's balance on `myblockchain2` with the [`cast call`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call?highlight=cast%20call#cast-call) foundry command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain2 $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_CHAIN2 "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```

```bash
500000000000000 [5e14]
```
