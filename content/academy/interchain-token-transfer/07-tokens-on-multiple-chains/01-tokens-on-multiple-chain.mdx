The token bridge also supports "multi-hop" transfers, where tokens can be transferred between remote chains via the home chain. To illustrate, consider two remotes _R<sub>a</sub>_ and _R<sub>b</sub>_ that are both connected to the same home _H_. A multi-hop transfer from _R<sub>a</sub>_ to _R<sub>b</sub>_ first gets routed from _R<sub>a</sub>_ to _H_, where the remote balances are updated, and then _H_ automatically routes the transfer on to _R<sub>b</sub>_.

In this example, our _R<sub>a</sub>_ chain is `myblockchain`, our _R<sub>b</sub>_ chain is `myblockchain2`, and _H_ chain is the Avalanche C-Chain.

### What we will do

1. Deploy a new local blockchain `myblockchain2`
2. Deploy a new `ERC20TokenRemote` contract to `myblockchain2`
3. Register the new `ERC20TokenRemote` contract with the `TokenHome` contract on the Avalanche C-Chain
3. Perform a multi-hop transfer of `TOK` from `myblockchain` to `myblockchain2`, with a 'hop' through the Avalanche C-Chain
