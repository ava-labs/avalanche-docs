### Deploy the Remote Contract

Using the [`forge create`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create) command, we will deploy the `ERC20TokenRemote.sol` contract, passing in the following constructor arguments:

- Interchain Messaging Registry Address **(for `myblockchain2`)**
- Interchain Messaging Manager (our funded address)
- Source Blockchain ID (hexidecimal representation of Avalanche C-Chain)
- Token Home Address (address of `NativeTokenHome.sol` deployed on Avalanche C-Chain in the [Deploy a Home Contract](/course/interchain-token-transfer/06-erc-20-to-erc-20-bridge/03-deploy-home) section)
- Token Name (input in the constructor of the [wrapped token contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol))
- Token Symbol (input in the constructor of the [wrapped token contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol))
- Token Decimals (uint8 integer representing number of decimal places for the ERC20 token being created. Most ERC20 tokens follow the Ethereum standard, which defines 18 decimal places.)

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain2 --private-key $PK \
lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenRemote/ERC20TokenRemote.sol:ERC20TokenRemote \
--constructor-args "(${TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_CHAIN2}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN}, 18)" "TOK" "TOK" 18
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Remote Contract Address

Note the address the remote contract was "Deployed to".

```bash
export ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_CHAIN2=<"Deployed to" address>
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Register Remote Contract with Home Contract

After deploying the bridge contracts, you'll need to register the remote bridge by sending a dummy message using the `registerWithHome` method. This message includes details which inform the Home Bridge about your destination blockchain and bridge settings, eg. `initialReserveImbalance`.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain2 --private-key $PK $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_CHAIN2 \
"registerWithHome((address, uint256))" "(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0)"
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Approve tokens for the Token Remote contract on `myblockchain`
Now that our `ERC20TokenRemote` contract is deployed and configured on `myblockchain2`, we need to prepare `myblockchain` for the token transfer. 
We will approve the `ERC20TokenRemote` contract to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the sender.

You can increase/decrease the numbers here as per your requirements. (All values are mentioned in wei)

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 \
"approve(address, uint256)" $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 2000000000000000000000
```
