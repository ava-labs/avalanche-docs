This guide will walk you through the process of using a bridge between 2 Avalanche blockchains, providing a step-by-step approach to ensure a smooth and secure experience.

Go to [ohmywarp.com](https://ohmywarp.com) and connect any web3 [wallet](https://core.app). Make sure your wallet has at least some AVAX on the Fuji Testnet. If you need funds you can go to the [faucet](https://faucet.avax.network). Use the coupon code `avalanche-academy` to get AVAX in C-chain

Mint some `TLP` token on `C-Chain` in the Mint tab. This is an ERC20 deployed on Fuji's C-chain.
Finally bridge some `TLP` to `Dispatch`. You can confirm the transfer in the Mint tab.
