The interfaces `IERC20SendAndCallReceiver` or `INativeSendAndCallReceiver` are used for contracts that handle receiving ERC20 or native tokens of the Interchain Token Transfer protocol. They are similar to the `ITeleporterReceiver` interface, but they are specifically designed to handle token transfers.

### IERC20SendAndCallReceiver

The `receiveTokens` function will be called by the Transferrer bridge contract. The contract must implement this function to receive the tokens and can retrieve all the information about the origin of the tokens, the token, the bridge used, and the amount of tokens transferred from the parameters.

```solidity title="lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/interfaces/IERC20SendAndCallReceiver.sol"
/**
 * @notice Interface for contracts that are called to receive token transfers.
 */
interface IERC20SendAndCallReceiver {
    /**
     * @notice Called to receive the amount of the given token
     * @param sourceBlockchainID Blockchain ID that the transfer originated from
     * @param originTokenTransferrerAddress Address of the token transferrer that initiated the Teleporter message
     * @param originSenderAddress Address of the sender that sent the transfer. This value
     * should only be trusted if {originTokenTransferrerAddress} is verified and known.
     * @param token Address of the token to be received
     * @param amount Amount of the token to be received
     * @param payload Arbitrary data provided by the caller
     */
    function receiveTokens(
        bytes32 sourceBlockchainID,
        address originTokenTransferrerAddress,
        address originSenderAddress,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata payload
    ) external;
}
```

### INativeSendAndCallReceiver

The `INativeSendAndCallReceiver` interface is used for contracts that handle receiving native tokens of the Interchain Token Transfer protocol. It is similar to the `IERC20SendAndCallReceiver` interface, but does not include the `token` and `amount` parameters. The `receiveTokens` is now `payable`. There is only a single native token on each chain, so the address is not needed. The amount can be determined from calling `msg.value`.

```solidity title="lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/interfaces/INativeSendAndCallReceiver.sol"
/**
 * @notice Interface for a contracts that are called to receive native tokens.
 */
interface INativeSendAndCallReceiver {
    /**
     * @notice Called to receive the amount of the native token. Implementations
     * must properly handle the msg.value of the call in order to ensure it doesn't
     * become improperly made inaccessible.
     * @param sourceBlockchainID Blockchain ID that the transfer originated from
     * @param originTokenTransferrerAddress Address of the token transferrer that initiated the Teleporter message
     * @param originSenderAddress Address of the sender that sent the transfer. This value
     * should only be trusted if {originTokenTransferrerAddress} is verified and known.
     * @param payload Arbitrary data provided by the caller
     */
    function receiveTokens(
        bytes32 sourceBlockchainID,
        address originTokenTransferrerAddress,
        address originSenderAddress,
        bytes calldata payload
    ) external payable;
}
```
