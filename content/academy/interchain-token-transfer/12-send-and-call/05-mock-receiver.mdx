In this section, you will deploy mock receiver contracts on the Avalanche L1. 

<Steps>
<Step>

### Receiver Deployment

You can choose to deploy either the `MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver` or the `MockNativeSendAndCallReceiver` contract depending your token type.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/mocks/MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver.sol:MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save Receiver Address

After deployment, save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable for future use.

```bash
export MOCK_RECEIVER_ADDRESS=<address>
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Send Tokens

Use the following command to send tokens to the mock receiver contract:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN \
"sendAndCall((bytes32, address, address, bytes, uint256, uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256), uint256)" \
"(${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1}, ${MOCK_RECEIVER_ADDRESS}, 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 2500000, 2000000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0)" 100000000000000000000
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify the Results

Check the logs and emitted events to verify that the tokens were received correctly.

After successfully deploying the contract, move on to testing the mock receivers.
