There is only a single native token to a chain. However, to allow to represent a wide range of assets on EVM-chains, the ERC-20 token standard was developed. "ERC" stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and "20" is the proposal identifier.

ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. These tokens are typically created and managed through smart contracts that adhere to the ERC-20 standard, which defines a set of rules and functions that ensure interoperability between different tokens and decentralized applications (DApps). 

At the base of an ERC-20 token smart contract, there is a simple mapping of addresses to numbers, which represent the amount of tokens an address holds (balance). 

```solidity
abstract contract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata, IERC20Errors {
    
  mapping(address account => uint256) private _balances;
	
  //...
}
```
These addresses may belong to EOA or contract accounts. Both of these can hold and transfer ERC-20 tokens. 

ERC-20 tokens can represent various assets, from digital currencies to tokenized assets, and they play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by enabling the creation of decentralized applications with diverse functionalities, such as token sales, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and more.

## Interface

To maintain compatibility with dApps designed to work with the ERC20 standard, all ERC20 tokens implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface IERC20 {

    function name() external view returns (string memory);

    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);

    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);

    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

## Transfer Tokens

Transferring ERC-20 tokens between accounts involves calling the 'transfer' function, specifying the recipientâ€™s address and the amount to transfer. 

To facilitate more complex interactions, such as those involving smart contracts, the ERC-20 standard includes the `approve()` and `transferFrom()` functions. We will check how to implement those so smart contracts can use funds according to its code.

### `approve()`

Since all balances are just a mapping of amount values to addresses, the owner of each address can 'approve' some other account as a _spender of their funds up to some limit determined by the approved _amount. The spender then will be able to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the value set in amount.

### `allowance()`

Returns the amount which _spender is still allowed to withdraw from _owner.

### `transferFrom()`

Transfers _value amount of tokens from address _from to address _to
