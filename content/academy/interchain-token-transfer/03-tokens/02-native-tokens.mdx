A native token in a blockchain running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) refers to the primary digital currency or cryptocurrency native to the EVM blockchain. Every EVM layer 1 chain has it's own native token:

- Ethereum: ETH
- Avalanche C-Chain: AVAX
- Dexalot: ALOT
- many more...

The native token serves as both a means of value transfer within the EVM network and as the gas token for executing transfers or smart contracts. Therefore, native tokens play a crucial role in the EVM chain by enabling participants to interact with and utilize the platform's decentralized features, serving as the foundational unit of value.
