Alright, let's create our first contract. Head to the Avalanche Starter Kit Codespace and create a new folder called my-contracts in the _src_ folder.

Now in there create a new file called HelloWorld.sol and paste the following contents:

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```

Now let's deploy the contract:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK src/my-contracts/HelloWorld.sol:HelloWorld --broadcast
```

If deployed successfully we should see something like this:

```bash
[⠒]
Deployer: 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Deployed to: 0x52C84043CD9c865236f11d9Fc9F56aa003c1f922
Transaction hash: 0x28247e1292e9489c3b51456e2b848eeb6b82ccbcda18836a638f5d81605ac508
```

This means we have deployed our contract to the address 0x52C84043CD9c865236f11d9Fc9F56aa003c1f922. Using this address we can now call our contract:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c 0x52C84043CD9c865236f11d9Fc9F56aa003c1f922 "sayHello()(string)"
```

Don't forget to replace the contract address with the one your contract was deployed to. The result should look like this:

```solidity
"Hello World"
```
