# Intro ERC-20 Tokens

## Fungible Token Standard

Previously, we explored the concept of smart contracts and how they can be used to execute predefined rules on a blockchain. One of the most impactful use cases of smart contracts is the implementation of token standards. The **ERC-20** standard was introduced to create a universal and interoperable framework for tokens on the EVM.

The ERC-20 standard defines a set of functions and events that a token contract must implement, making it easier for wallets, exchanges, and applications to interact with these tokens. As a result, ERC-20 tokens have become the foundation for countless decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, governance systems, and utility applications.

To better understand why ERC-20 is such a critical part of EVM’s ecosystem, let's first explore the concept of fungibility.

## Fungibility

Fungibility refers to an asset’s ability to be exchanged for another of the same type without any difference in value. Let’s use currency as an example:

- A $10 bill is considered fungible because it holds the same value as another $10 bill. If you exchange one $10 bill for another, their value remains the same.
- Similarly, you can break a $10 bill into smaller denominations like two $5 bills or ten $1 bills, without changing the total value.

ERC-20 tokens are fungible by design. For instance:

- 1 unit of an ERC-20 token (e.g., USDC or USDT) is indistinguishable and interchangeable with any other unit of the same token.
- The fungibility of ERC-20 tokens makes them ideal for use cases such as stablecoins, governance tokens, and liquidity pool assets.

However, fungibility also introduces a limitation: if a use case requires unique attributes for individual tokens, the ERC-20 standard is insufficient. For such scenarios, the ERC-721 standard is used instead, as we will discusse in next chapter.

## ERC-20: The Standard

The ERC-20 token standard was designed to simplify the implementation of fungible tokens and ensure compatibility across various EVM-based applications. At its core, an ERC-20 token contract allows the following operations:

- Tracking balances of token holders.
- Transferring tokens between accounts.
- Approving other accounts to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
- Querying details about the token, such as its name, symbol, and total supply.

Below is the interface for ERC-20 tokens as defined in the original proposal:

```solidity
interface ERC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bool);
    
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
