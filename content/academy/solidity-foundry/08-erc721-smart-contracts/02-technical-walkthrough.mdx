Just like with the ERC-20 chapter, in this section we will examine each of the functions that make up the ERC-721 interface. Below is the ERC-721 interface seen from the last section:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;
​
/// @title ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x80ac58cd.
interface ERC721 {
    /// @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.
    ///  This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed
    ///  (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any number of NFTs
    ///  may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer. At the time of
    ///  any transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
​
    /// @dev This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or
    ///  reaffirmed. The zero address indicates there is no approved address.
    ///  When a Transfer event emits, this also indicates that the approved
    ///  address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
​
    /// @dev This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner.
    ///  The operator can manage all NFTs of the owner.
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
​
    /// @notice Count all NFTs assigned to an owner
    /// @dev NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid, and this
    ///  function throws for queries about the zero address.

```

__balanceOf(address _owner)__
Similar to the function of the same name in the ERC20 interface, balanceOf returns the number of non-fungible tokens that _owner has.

__ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)__
This function returns the address that owns the non-fungible token with id _tokenId
__safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)__
This function is very similar to the transferFrom function in the ERC-20 specification. safeTransferFrom transfer a NFT of id _tokenId from _from to _to . However, after transferring the token, safeTransferFrom checks if the account is capable of handling the NFT (via passing in the arguments _from, _to, _tokenId, and data. If _to is not capable of handling the NFT, safeTransferFrom reverts.
__safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)__
This function behaves exactly like the function above, except that the argument data is set to the empty string.
__transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)__
This function behaves exactly like safeTransferFrom, except that we do not check if _to is capable of receiving the NFT with id _tokenId.
__approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)__
When called, this function gives _approved transfer rights to the NFT with id _tokenId. This function fails if an account without transfer rights to the NFT is the caller.
__setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved)__
When called, this function gives _operator either transfer rights to all NFTs of the function caller (if _approved is true) or revokes transfer rights to all NFTs of the function caller (if _approved is false).
__getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)__
This function returns the address of the account with transfer rights to the NFT with id _tokenId.
__isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator)__
This function returns true if _operator has transfer rights to all of the NFTs that _owner holds, and false otherwise.
