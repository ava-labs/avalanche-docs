We again come across the question of how to deploy a ERC-721 token on the blockchain. Since we have access to the ERC-721 contract interface, there is nothing stopping us from writing our own implementation of an ERC-721 token. However, if you recall the deployment section of the ERC-20 chapter, then you know that we were able to use OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard to autogenerate our own ERC-20 contract. Likewise, OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard also allows to create ERC-721 tokens on the fly. For the rest of this section, we will look at just that!

## Autogenerating a ERC-721 Token
To start, head over to [wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721](wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) where you should see the following:

As with the ERC-20 section, the base contract MyToken is deriving the ERC721 contract, which contains the logic necessary for a functional ERC-721 token contract. MyToken, in essence, allows us to define the initial values of our ERC-721 token. Just like the ERC-20 contract, we can also inherit optional features for our ERC-721 token as well. Below is an example of us customizing our ERC-721 token:

To end off the ERC-721 chapter, we will look at one particular feature that makes ERC-721 token special: the URI Storage feature.
