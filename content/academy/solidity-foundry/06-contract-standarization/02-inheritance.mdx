In the previous section, we foreshadowed inheritance, a concept that Solidity shares with other object-oriented programming languages. In this section, we will go over how to inherit other smart contracts and introduce inheritance in the concept of contract constructors.

## B is A

At the most fundamental level, contract inheritance works as follows:

```solidity
contract A {}
​
contract B is A {}
```

In the code snippet above, we have an arbitrary contract A and a contract B which inherits A. Although simple, this doesn't really explain the full concept of inheritance. Let's consider a more sophisticated example:

```solidity
contract A {
  uint num;
  
  function square(uint base) public pure returns(uint) {
        return base ** 2;
  }
}
​
contract B is A {}
```

In the code above, we have two contract A and B. The definition of contract A is nothing new, but what about contract B? Well, since B is inheriting A, this implies that B has the following properties:

- B has the state variable num
- B has the function square

To really drive home the idea of inheritance, let's consider this final code snippet:

```solidity
contract A {
  
  uint private num1;
  string internal name;
  
  function getOne() private pure returns(uint) {
    return 1;
  }
  
  function getTwo() public pure returns(uint) {
    return 2;
  }
}
​
contract B is A {}
```

The code snippet above is more sophisticated in that we are explicitly introducing visibility in the context of inheritance. Again, the definition of A should be trivial. Focusing on B, we have the following:

- B does not have the state variable num1 and the function getOne, since these are marked as private and therefore, belong only to A
- B has the state variable name since it is marked as internal and therefore, able to be derived by B
- B has the function getTwo since it is marked as public

## Constructors and Inheritance

Just like we can inherit functions from parent functions, we can also inherit constructors from parent contracts. The syntax for inheriting parent functions is as follows:

```solidity
constructor() <parent-name>() {}

```

An example of constructor inheritance can be found below:

```solidity

contract A {
  uint numl;
  constructor() {
    num1 = 5;
  }
}
​
contract B is A {
  uint num2;
  constructor() A() {
    num2 = 7;
  }
}   
```

For contract A, we are setting num1 equal to 5 at the time of initialization. For contract B, we first call the constructor of A (which sets num1 in B to 5) and then sets num2 to 7.
