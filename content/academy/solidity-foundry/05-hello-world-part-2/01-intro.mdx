If you've made it this far into the course, congratulations! At this point so far, you are now able to write very simple smart contracts which can be compiled down into EVM bytecode and deployed onto the blockchain! In this chapter, we will consider the following questions:

- How can we utilize Solidity's built-in data structures?
- How can we use control flow in our functions?
- How can we store data on the blockchain in a cheap manner?
- How can we utilize contract constructors?
- What does the Solidity inheritance model look like?

In this chapter, we will tackle the questions above. By looking into these questions, we will learn the skills necessary for taking our smart contracts from being simple programs to complex ones.
