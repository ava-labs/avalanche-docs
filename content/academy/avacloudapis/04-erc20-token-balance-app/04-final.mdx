If we implemented the code correctly, we should have a working ERC-20 token balance app that displays the user's token balances. The app will look like the following:
![](/course-images/avacloudsdk/balance-app-init.png)

After setting the address field, the app will display the user's ERC-20 token balances:

![](/course-images/avacloudsdk/balance-app.png)

Notice how the app also displays images for each token. This is done by fetching the token metadata from `listErc20Balances` and displaying the token's logo.
