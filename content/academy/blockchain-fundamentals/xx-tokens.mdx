Tokens are a concept that existed in societies for a long time. 

Tokens can be used to represent value. The most common valuable tokens we use every day are fiat currencies, like the US dollar. But there are also other kinds of tokens, such as points or miles in loyalty programs. Today we can also tokenize other assets, such as property titles.

## Fungible Tokens

Fungibility means that different tokens can be considered of equal value. Let's take for example two one dollar bills. Most people will not care if they get one or the other. They both offer the same utility. 

## Non-Fungible Tokens

Non-fungible tokens are not considered equal. The most prominent use cases are Art-NFTs. While the tokens may follow a standard of how they can be transfered, they may not be interchangeable. Two pieces of art may have very different values.
