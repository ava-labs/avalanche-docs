Programs and apps are software applications designed to run on different types of computers, such as smartphones, PCs, and web servers. On smartphones, apps are typically designed for specific tasks like messaging, gaming, or social media, optimized for touch interfaces and mobile connectivity. PCs run more complex programs, such as word processors, video editors, or development tools, which take advantage of larger screens, more powerful hardware, and the ability to handle multitasking. Web servers, on the other hand, run server-side applications that power websites, process data, and handle multiple user requests simultaneously. These programs often provide the backend services that apps on smartphones and PCs rely on to function.

Similarly, smart contracts or decentralized applications (dApps) are programs that run on a blockchain. A smart contract is a self-executing program with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, operating without the need for a trusted central authority. dApps are more complex, often consisting of multiple smart contracts that together offer a full application experience on the blockchain. Like traditional apps, these blockchain-based programs can perform a wide range of tasks, from managing digital assets to running decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Different types of applications can interoperate across these platforms, enabling a seamless user experience. For instance, a mobile app can interact with a backend running on a web server to fetch or update data. Similarly, the same app could also interact with a smart contract on a blockchain to verify transactions or access decentralized services. This interoperability allows users to benefit from the strengths of each platform, combining the user-friendliness of mobile apps, the processing power of web servers, and the security and transparency of blockchain technology.
