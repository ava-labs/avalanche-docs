## Moving from a centralized Entity to a Collective of Validators

Blockchain systems achieve decentralization through the use of a network of validators, sometimes referred to as nodes, miners, or stakers, depending on the underlying consensus mechanism. Validators are responsible for verifying and securing transactions, maintaining the integrity of the blockchain, and ensuring that the system remains decentralized and trustless. Decentralization is achieved by distributing the responsibility of maintaining the network across numerous independent participants.

Decentralization in blockchain is achieved through a network of validators. These are independent entities that run the blockchain software, perform computations, and ensure the integrity of the blockchain. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Computation Execution: Each validator independently performs the same computation. For example, let's consider a simple computation: 5 + 3.
Consensus Process: After performing the computation, validators share their results with each other. They then use a process called consensus to agree on the correct result. You can think of it as a election, where all validators vote on the correct answer.
The consensus process ensures that all validators reach an agreement on the correct result, given that the majority is honest. This agreement is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain. If a validator tries to cheat or provide an incorrect result, the other validators will detect the discrepancy, and the cheating validator will be penalized.
