In this chapter we will dive deeper in the payments use case. We will explore how blockchain technology can be used to build a decentralized payment system. We will look at the different components of a payment system, such as account balances, transactions, and user interactions. We will also discuss the benefits of using blockchain technology for payments, such as security, transparency, and decentralization.

| Use Case                  | Data Structures  	| User Interactions  	|
|-----------------------	|------------------	|--------------------	|
| Payments              	| Account Balances 	| Transfer Funds     	|
| Decentralized Finance 	| Loans, ...       	| Borrow, Repay, ..  	|
| Voting Systems        	| Votes            	| Vote               	|
| Supply Chain          	| Shipments        	| Hand Over, Deliver 	|
| Identity Management   	| Certificates     	| Issue, Proof       	|

Many of the concepts we will discuss in this chapter are applicable to other use cases as well. For example, the idea of account balances and transactions is not unique to payments but can be found in other applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) or supply chain management. Similarly, user interactions such as transferring funds or voting can be applied to various use cases, each with its unique requirements and challenges.

So while we are discussing this specific use case, try to think about how these concepts could be adapted to other scenarios. This will help you understand the broader implications of blockchain technology and how it can be used to solve a wide range of problems across different industries and domains.
