## Why take this Course?

A significant innovation in blockchain is the development of multi-chain systems, such as Avalanche, which provide a significant improvement in scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. At the core of these multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains powered by different virtual machines simultaneously. Each VM of a chain is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.


Configuring and modifying the EVM is an efficient way to create a specialized virtual machine, as it allows developers to build upon years of active community work and leverage the extensive ecosystem surrounding the EVM, including wallets, explorers, and development frameworks.
## Course Content

<Steps>
<Step>

### EVM Basics & Precompiles

In the first section of the course we will go through some basic concepts of the EVM, such as the account-based model, keys, addresses, transactions, and blocks. Furthermore, we will explain what a precompile is and show you how to interact with a precompile on the Fuji testnet.
</Step>
<Step>
### Development Environment Setup

We will explore various ways to set up a development environment for building customized EVMs. You'll learn about GitHub Codespaces and Development Containers (`.devcontainer`). If you choose a local setup, you'll install a code editor, the Go language, configure your shell, and install additional dependencies.

### Hands-On Exercises

The following sections contain hands-on exercises where you customize the EVM. The difficulty of the customizations will increase from section to section. Find out more about each exercise by clicking its name below:

    - Read from and write to the EVM state
    - Define the initial state in the precompileConfig
    - Add solidity tests for your precompile

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Build a Permissioned Precompile (Coming Soon)">

    Learn to build permissioned precompiles by building a XXX precompile and master the following skills in addition to the previous sections:
    
    - Add permissions to only allow certain addresses to interact with the precompile 
    - Define the initial permissions in the precompileConfig
    - Change the permissions on the fly

    </Accordion>

## Prerequisites

### Avalanche

This course is intended for people with a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. **Virtual Machines**: What they are and what VM customization means
2. **Blockchains**: What the components are of a blockchain and how they interact, specifically how Avalanche L1s leverage precompiles.

If some of this is not clear, I strongly recommend taking the [Avalanche Fundamentals](/course/avalanche-fundamentals) and [Multi-Chain Architecture](/course/multi-chain-architecture) courses first.

### Coding

You will need a general understanding of software development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to be able to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

1. **Solidity**: Basic knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces. Familiarity with Foundry will help in advanced sections. 
2. **Go**: You don't necessarily need to know Go, but should have some experience with an advanced object-oriented and typed language (C, C++, Java, Typescript)
3. **Testing**: It will help you in later sections if you are generally familiar with the concept of unit testing

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand what Precompiles are and when to use them.
- Understand how developing precompiles allows developers to create more optimized and capable blockchain systems, enabling them to address entirely new use cases that were previously unattainable.
- Apply the knowledge gained in the course by building multiple precompiles
