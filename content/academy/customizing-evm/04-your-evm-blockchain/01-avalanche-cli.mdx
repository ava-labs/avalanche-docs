## What is the Avalanche CLI?

The Avalanche CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers comprehensive access to Avalanche's functionalities, making it easier to build and test independent blockchains.

Each Avalanche network includes the Primary Network, which consists of the Contract (C), Platform (P), and Exchange (X) chains. It's important to note that "Primary Network" refers to a special Avalanche L1 rather than a distinct, standalone network.

Your local network operates independently from both the Mainnet and Fuji Testnet. You can even run an Avalanche L1 offline. Local Avalanche networks support, but are not limited to, the following commands:

- **Start and Stop a Network**: Easily start or stop a local network.
- **Health Check**: Check the health status of each node in the network.
- **Create Blockchains**: Spin up new blockchains with custom parameters.

Managing a local network with multiple nodes can be complex, but the Avalanche CLI simplifies the process with user-friendly commands.

## Usage

The Precompile-EVM repository comes preloaded with the Avalanche CLI and Foundry, so you donâ€™t need to install additional tools when working within Codespaces. Just use the terminal in your Codespace to run Avalanche CLI commands and start building.
