To ensure that the blockchain is up and running, let's perform a simple token transfer to a random address, `0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc`, using Foundry:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK 0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc --value 1ether
```
To verify if the transaction was successful, check the balance of the address with the following command:


```bash
cast balance --rpc-url myblockchain 0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc
```
```bash
1000000000000000000
```
You should see that the balance of the address `0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc` is now 1 (1 * 10^18).


Congratulations! You have successfully sent tokens on your EVM blockchain. ðŸŽ‰
