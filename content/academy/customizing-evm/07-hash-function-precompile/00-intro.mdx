## What We're Building

In this section, we'll create a precompile for the MD5 hash function. By utilizing the existing Go library for this hash function, we can avoid reimplementing the algorithm in Solidity and take advantage of Go's superior efficiency.

<Accordion title="What is a Hash Function?">

A hash function is a special type of function that takes input data of any size (such as a letter, a word, the text of a book, or even all combined texts available on the internet) and converts it into a fixed-size output. This output, known as a hash value, represents the original data. The process is often referred to as "hashing."

Hash functions possess several key properties:

- **Deterministic**: Given the same input, a hash function will always produce the same output. For instance, hashing the word "apple" a thousand times will yield the same hash value each time.
- **Fixed Size**: Regardless of the input data size—whether it's a single character or an entire novel—the hash function always produces an output (the hash value) of a consistent length.
- **Fast Computation**: Hash functions are designed to be quick and efficient, returning a hash value with minimal computational resources and time.
- **Preimage Resistance**: It's computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input data from the hash value alone. This property is especially crucial in cryptographic hash functions for data security.
- **Avalanche Effect**: A small change to the input should cause significant changes in the output, making the new hash value appear uncorrelated with the old one. For example, hashing "apple" and "Apple" should produce completely different hash values.
- **Collision Resistance**: It is highly unlikely for two different pieces of input data to yield the same hash value. However, due to the limited length of hash values, collisions are theoretically possible. A good hash function minimizes the occurrence of such collisions.

Hash functions are utilized in various applications across computer science, including data retrieval, data integrity verification, password storage, and in blockchain technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Reference Implementation

To aid your understanding of building precompiles, we will compare each step with a reference example: a precompile for the SHA256 hash function. Both precompiles are quite similar, featuring a single function that returns the hashed value.
