## Build Your Custom VM

There's a simple build script in the Precompile-EVM we can utilize to build. First, make sure you are in the root folder of you Precompile-EVM:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm
```

Then run the command to initiate the build script:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

If you do not see any error, the build was successful.

## Run a Local Network with Your Custom VM

You can run you customized Precompile-EVM by using the Avalanche CLI.

First, create the configuration for your blockchain with custom VM.

```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain --custom --vm $AVALANCHEGO_PLUGIN_PATH/srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy --genesis ./.devcontainer/genesis-example.json
```

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you replace the binary name with the actual binary name of your Precompile-EVM, and genesis file with the actual path to your genesis file.
</Callout>

Next, launch the Avalanche L1 with your custom VM:

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain
```

After around 1 minute the blockchain should have been created and some more output should appear in the terminal. You'll also see the RPC URL of your blockchain in the terminal.
