Throughout this chapter, we've covered storing variables in the EVM state. However, all of this was through the use of StringStore/Counter Solidity interface. An important part of stateful precompiles is the ability to initialize values stored by our precompiled contracts.

In the next few chapters, we'll see how to initialize the values of our precompiled contracts by manually setting the values or allowing for the values to be defined in the `genesis.json` file.
