In this part of the course, we'll explore how to optimize your EVM through chain configuration, tailoring it to fit specific use cases. Customizing EVM configurations is a key advantage of multi-chain systems.

## Exercise

In this section, you won’t need to write any Go code. Instead, we’ll adjust values in the JSON file of the genesis block.

## Topics

We will cover the following topics:

- **Genesis Block**: The foundation of any blockchain. We’ll review its components and how to customize its properties.
- **Fee Configuration**: Learn how to balance validator incentives with user affordability. This is crucial for managing network congestion and discouraging wasteful transactions on public networks.
- **Initial Token Allocation**: Understand how to define the initial token distribution in your custom EVM, setting your network up for success.
- **Preinstalled Precompiles**: Discover how to configure preinstalled precompiles to leverage features like restricting who can issue transactions or deploy contracts on your chain.

Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to run a local EVM with a custom Genesis Block. This exercise will solidify your understanding and allow you to observe the performance impact of your EVM customizations.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you'll be able to effectively customize the EVM in Avalanche, unlocking new possibilities for your blockchain projects. Let’s dive into EVM customization and chain configuration together!
