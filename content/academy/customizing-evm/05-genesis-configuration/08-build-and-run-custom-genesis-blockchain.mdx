### Build Your Precompile-EVM

There's a simple build script in the Precompile-EVM we can utilize to build. First, make sure you are in the root folder of you Precompile-EVM:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm
```

Then run the command to initiate the build script:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Create your blockchain configuration

You can run your Precompile-EVM by using the Avalanche CLI.

First, create the configuration for your blockchain:

```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain \
 --custom \
 --vm $VM_PATH \
 --genesis "./.devcontainer/genesis-example.json" \
 --force \
 --sovereign=false \
 --evm-token "TOK" \
 --warp \
 --icm
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Launch L1 with you customized EVM

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain --local
```

After around 1 minute, the blockchain should have been created, and additional output will appear in
the terminal. You'll also see the RPC URL of your blockchain in the terminal.
