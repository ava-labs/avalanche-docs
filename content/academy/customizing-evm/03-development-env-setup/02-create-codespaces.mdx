## Open Precompile-EVM Repository

Open the Precompile-EVM Repository on the `avalanche-academy-start` branch: [Precompile-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/tree/avalanche-academy-start)

## Create Codespace

Make sure you are on the branch `avalanche-academy-start`. Then click Code and then Create codespace on `avalanche-academy-start`:

Next a window opens and the Codespace is built. This may take a few minutes.

When the building is completed, you can access the Codespace through the browser IDE.

## Closing Codespaces

The codespace time out after 30 minutes of inactivity by default. So if you are not too worried about the 30 hour/month limit, just close the window or the tab. Alternatively, you can open the command prompt (Cmd + Shift + P) and issue the command: **Stop Current Codespace**.

You can see your Codespaces on https://github.com/codespaces/. There you can stop them, reopen them and delete them.
