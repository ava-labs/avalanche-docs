In order to create a new Blockchain from our customized EVM, we have to define a Genesis block just as we did in out section earlier.

To incorporate the CalculatorPlus precompile as part of the genesis block, we need to create a new genesis file and include a key for the CalculatorPlus precompile in the configuration JSON. This key, in particular, is the `configKey` that we specified in the `module.go` file of the Calculator precompile in the previous section.

Copy over `Calculator.json` into a new file called `CalculatorPlus.json` and add the necessary key-pair value to the config.
