## Reference Implementation

In this section, we will showcase how to build a more complex precompile that offers selected simple math operations. Our calculator will support the following operations:

1. Add two numbers and return the result (3 + 5 = 8)
2. Get the next two greater numbers (7 => 8, 9)
3. Repeat a string x times (4, b => bbbb)

This is somewhat odd calculator and real-life usability might not be the best, but as you will see in a bit the operations have been chosen to demonstrate some different scenarios we might face while building precompiles.

## What You Are Building

Similar to the Calculator precompile, you will be building a precompile called **CalculatorPlus** which contains the following mathematical functions:

- **Powers of Three**: takes in as input an integer base; returns the square, cube, and 4th power of the input
- **Modulo+**: takes in as input two arguments: the dividend and the divisor. Returns how many times the dividend fits in the divisor, and the remainder.
- **Simplify Fraction**: takes in two arguments: the numerator and the denominator. Returns the simplfied version of the fraction (if the denominator is 0, we return 0)

## Overview of Steps

Compared to the process before, we will now also add tests for our precompile. Here's a quick overview of the steps we're going to follow:
 
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a Solidity interface for the precompile
</Step>
<Step>
Generate the ABI
</Step>
<Step>
Write the precompile code in Go
</Step>
<Step>
Configure and register the precompile
</Step>
<Step>
Add and run tests
</Step>
<Step>
Build and run your customized EVM
</Step>
<Step>
Connect Remix to your customized EVM and interact with the precompile
</Step>
</Steps>

This tutorial will help you understand how to create more complex precompiles. Let's begin!
