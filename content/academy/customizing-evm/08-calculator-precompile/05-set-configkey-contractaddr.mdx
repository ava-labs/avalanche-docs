## ConfigKey

Just as with the MD5 precompile in the previous section, go to the `module.go` file and set a `ConfigKey`.

## Contract Address

In the same file, set a `ContractAddress`. Choose one that has not been used by other precompiles of earlier sections.

## Registration

Go to the `plugin/main.go` file and register the new precompile.
