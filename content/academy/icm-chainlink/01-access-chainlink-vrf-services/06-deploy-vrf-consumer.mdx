Now that the `CrossChainVRFWrapper` is deployed on a Chainlink-supported L1, it’s time to deploy the `CrossChainVRFConsumer` contract on the L1 where Chainlink VRF is not supported. This contract will handle requests for random words and interact with the **TeleporterMessenger** to communicate with the supported L1.

<Steps>
<Step>
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- The `TeleporterMessenger` contract address on the unsupported L1.
- The deployed `CrossChainVRFWrapper` on the supported L1. `($VRF_WRAPPER)`
</Step>
<Step>
## Deploy the Contract
Use the following command to deploy the `CrossChainVRFConsumer` contract on your unsupported L1.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/CrossChainVRFConsumer.sol:CrossChainVRFConsumer --constructor-args <TELEPORTER_MESSENGER_ADDRESS> $VRF_WRAPPER --broadcast
```

Replace the following:

- `<RPC_URL>`: The RPC URL for the L1.
- `<PRIVATE_KEY>`: The private key for the account used to deploy the contract.
- `<TELEPORTER_MESSENGER_ADDRESS>`: The address of the `TeleporterMessenger` contract on your unsupported L1.

After deployment, save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable for future use.

```bash
export VRF_CONSUMER=<address>
```
</Step>
<Step>
## Verify the Deployment
Once the `CrossChainVRFConsumer` contract is deployed, verify the contract’s address and confirm that it has been successfully deployed on your L1 using a block explorer.
