## Getting Started

To integrate Ramp into your application:

2. **Install the SDK**: For web applications, add the Ramp SDK to your project:
   ```bash
   npm install @ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk
   ```

3. **Initialize the On-Ramp Widget**: Implement the widget in your application:
   ```javascript
   import { RampInstantSDK } from '@ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk';
   
   const ramp = new RampInstantSDK({
     hostAppName: 'Your App Name',
     hostLogoUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/logo.png',
     swapAsset: 'AVAX',
     swapAmount: '100000000000000000', // Optional, in wei
     userAddress: '0x...', // User's wallet address
     hostApiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
     variant: 'auto', // or 'desktop', 'mobile', 'embedded'
     webhookStatusUrl: 'https://your-webhook-endpoint.com', // Optional
     defaultFlow: 'ONRAMP', // or 'OFFRAMP'
   });
   
   ramp.show();
   ```

4. **Implement Off-Ramp** (if needed):
   ```javascript
   import { RampInstantSDK } from '@ramp-network/ramp-instant-sdk';
   
   const ramp = new RampInstantSDK({
     hostAppName: 'Your App Name',
     hostLogoUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/logo.png',
     swapAsset: 'AVAX',
     userAddress: '0x...', // User's wallet address
     hostApiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
     variant: 'auto',
     defaultFlow: 'OFFRAMP',
   });
   
   ramp.show();
   ```

5. **Handle Events**: Listen for purchase events:
   ```javascript
   ramp.on('PURCHASE_CREATED', (event) => {
     console.log(`User started purchase: ${event.purchase.id}`);
   });
   
   ramp.on('PURCHASE_SUCCESSFUL', (event) => {
     console.log(`Purchase successful: ${event.purchase.id}`);
   });
   
   ramp.on('WIDGET_CLOSE', () => {
     console.log('Widget closed');
   });
   ```

6. **Test in Sandbox**: Use the sandbox environment to test your integration before going live:
   ```javascript
   const ramp = new RampInstantSDK({
     // ...your configuration
     url: 'https://ri-widget-staging.firebaseapp.com/', // Use staging environment
   });
   ```
