# How to contribute to Integrations

Create a `.mdx` file in `content/integrations` with the integrations name.

The file should have the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Integration Name
category: Integration Category (new categories will automatically be created when listed here). You can also add multiple categories by separating them with commas.
available: ["C-Chain", "All EVM L1s"]
description: A brief description of the integration
logo: /images/integration.png
developer: Integration Developer
website: <Link to integration's website>
documentation: <Link to integration's documentation>
---
```

To add an integration's logo, find the logo of the integration and place it in the `public/images` directory. **MAKE SURE THE LOGO HAS SOME TRANSPARENCY**. Then, reference the image in the frontmatter like so: `logo: /images/integration.png`

After the frontmatter, write the content for the integration. You can use the following template:

```md
## Overview
A brief overview of the integration.

A bulleted list of the integration's features.

## Getting Started
A brief guide on how to get started with the integration.

## Documentation
