## Getting Started

To integrate Transak into your application:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on the [Transak Partner Dashboard](https://partners.transak.com/signup) to get your API key.

2. **Choose Integration Method**:
   
   - **Direct URL Integration**: The simplest approach:
     ```javascript
     const transakUrl = new URL('https://global.transak.com/');
     transakUrl.searchParams.append('apiKey', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
     transakUrl.searchParams.append('defaultCryptoCurrency', 'AVAX');
     transakUrl.searchParams.append('network', 'avalanche');
     transakUrl.searchParams.append('walletAddress', userWalletAddress);
     
     window.open(transakUrl.href, '_blank');
     ```

   - **SDK Integration**: For web applications, add the Transak SDK to your project:
     ```bash
     npm install @transak/transak-sdk
     ```
     
     ```javascript
     import transakSDK from '@transak/transak-sdk';
     
     const transak = new transakSDK({
       apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
       environment: 'PRODUCTION', // or 'STAGING' for testing
       defaultCryptoCurrency: 'AVAX',
       network: 'avalanche',
       walletAddress: userWalletAddress, // Pre-fill user's wallet
       themeColor: '000000', // Custom color in hex
       hostURL: window.location.origin,
       widgetHeight: '650px',
       widgetWidth: '450px',
       hideMenu: false,
       exchangeScreenTitle: 'Buy Crypto',
       disableWalletAddressForm: false,
     });
     
     transak.init();
     ```

3. **Handle Events**: Listen for transaction events:
   ```javascript
   transak.on(transak.EVENTS.TRANSAK_WIDGET_CLOSE, () => {
     // Handle widget close
   });
   
   transak.on(transak.EVENTS.TRANSAK_ORDER_SUCCESSFUL, (orderData) => {
     // Handle successful purchase
     console.log(orderData);
   });
   
   transak.on(transak.EVENTS.TRANSAK_ORDER_FAILED, (orderData) => {
     // Handle failed purchase
     console.log(orderData);
   });
   ```

4. **Set Up Webhooks** (Optional): Implement server-side webhooks to receive transaction updates:
   ```javascript
   // Example Express.js webhook handler
   app.post('/transak-webhook', (req, res) => {
     const payload = req.body;
     
     if (payload.status === 'COMPLETED') {
       // Process completed transaction
     }
     
     res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
   });
   ```

5. **Test in Staging**: Use the staging environment with test cards to verify your integration before going live.
