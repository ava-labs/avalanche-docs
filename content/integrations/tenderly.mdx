## Overview
Tenderly provides a comprehensive Web3 infrastructure platform designed for developing, testing, and scaling decentralized applications (dApps). 
The platform offers high-performance node RPC services, development environments that mirror mainnet conditions, and an extensive suite of developer tools for monitoring and debugging smart contracts.

## Features
- **[Virtual TestNets](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=avalanche)**: Provides mainnet-like development environments for testing and staging smart contracts with unlimited faucet access.
- **[Simulator UI & Debugger](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=avalanche)**: Offers visual transaction debugging tools that reduce debugging time from hours to minutes.
- **[Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=avalanche)**: Enables accurate prediction of transaction outcomes and gas costs before on-chain execution.
- **[Alerts & Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=avalanche)**: Deliver real-time monitoring and automated responses to on-chain events.
- **[Node RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/node/rpc-reference?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=avalanche)**: Ensures high-performance, low-latency access across multiple regions with enterprise-grade reliability.
