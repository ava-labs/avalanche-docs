## Overview

VIA Labs provides Avalanche L1s with Proto-USD, a solution that enables seamless USDC integration across multiple blockchain networks. By combining Avalanche's native Interchain Messaging (ICM) infrastructure with Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), VIA Labs allows any Avalanche L1 to receive and utilize USDC from networks like Ethereum, Base, Solana, and other CCTP-enabled chains.

## Features

- **Native ICM Integration**: Utilizes Avalanche's built-in cross-chain messaging infrastructure.
- **USDC Cross-Chain Support**: Enables transfer of USDC between Avalanche L1s and other major blockchains.
- **Bridged USDC Standard**: Implements standardized approach for USDC representation across chains.
- **CCTP Compatibility**: Leverages Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for secure token transfers.
- **Testnet-Ready**: Available on testnet for all Avalanche L1s.
- **Path to Native Issuance**: Sets Avalanche L1s on an onboarding path to potential native USDC issuance.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Compatible with Ethereum, Base, Solana (coming soon), and other CCTP-enabled chains.

## Getting Started

To begin using VIA Labs' Proto-USD:

1. **Access Documentation**: Review the [VIA Labs Developer Documentation](https://developer.vialabs.io/general/package).
2. **Explore Demo**: Visit the [Proto-USD demo](https://avax.protousd.com/) to see the technology in action.
3. **Integration Steps**: 
   - Set up ICM infrastructure on your Avalanche L1
   - Configure CCTP message passing
   - Implement Proto-USD contracts
   - Test cross-chain USDC transfers
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to testnet first, then to mainnet after thorough testing.
