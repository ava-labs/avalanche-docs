## Overview

Ledger provides multiple SDKs that enable wallet applications and dApps to integrate hardware wallet functionality for Avalanche chains. The SDKs are available in Go and JavaScript, making it easy to add Ledger support to both desktop and web applications.

## Available SDKs

- **[Avalanche Ledger App](https://github.com/ava-labs/ledger-avalanche)**: Core application running on Ledger devices
- **[Go SDK](https://github.com/ava-labs/ledger-avalanche-go)**: Native Go implementation for backend and desktop applications
- **[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ava-labs/ledger-avalanche)**: Browser and Node.js support for web applications

## Integration Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Enable transaction signing across C-Chain, X-Chain, and P-Chain
- **Hardware-Based Security**: Leverage Ledger's secure element for key protection
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for both desktop and web applications
- **Transaction Signing**: Secure signing for transfers, staking, and smart contracts

## Getting Started

### Go SDK Integration

```go
import ledger "github.com/ava-labs/ledger-avalanche-go"

// Initialize connection
ledgerApp, err := ledger.NewLedgerApp()
if err != nil {
    // Handle connection error
}
```

### JavaScript SDK Integration

```javascript
import Ledger from '@avalabs/ledger-avalanche'
