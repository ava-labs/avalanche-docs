## Overview

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as **subgraphs**. The Graph’s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.


## Features

- **Decentralized Indexing**: Enables indexing blockchain data through multiple indexers, thus eliminating any single point of failure
- **GraphQL Queries**: Provides a powerful GraphQL interface for querying indexed data, making data retrieval super simple.
- **Customizable & Reusable**: Define your own logic for transforming & storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates data from multiple blockchain sources, offering a unified view for easier access and analysis.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data and scale with the needs of growing dApps and data requirements.


## Getting Started

Building a subgraph only takes a few minutes. It primarily consists of the following steps:

1. Initialize your subgraph project
2. Deploy & Publish
3. Query from your dapp

Here’s a detailed quick-start guide:

## Documentation

For detailed instructions on creating subgraphs, querying data, and integrating with The Graph, visit the [The Graph Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/).


## Use Cases

The Graph is ideal for a variety of blockchain data needs:

- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Efficiently index and query data for dApps, enabling enhanced functionality and user experiences.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data from multiple blockchain sources for comprehensive insights and analytics.
- **Data Retrieval**: Provide fast and reliable data retrieval for applications that require access to blockchain data.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Use The Graph to collect and analyze blockchain data, supporting reporting and decision-making processes.

## Conclusion

The Graph provides a robust solution for indexing and querying blockchain data. It effectively tackles the challenge of reading blockchain data without creating a centralized bottleneck. With its network of indexers, The Graph offers increased redundancy and quicker query responses. Using GraphQL queries, your dApp can pinpoint exactly the fields it requires.
