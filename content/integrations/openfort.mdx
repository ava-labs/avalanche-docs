## Overview
Openfort is a comprehensive Web3 development platform that enables developers to create embedded wallet experiences with advanced authentication flows. It provides secure key management, transaction handling, and gas sponsorship capabilities while maintaining compatibility with EVM chains including Avalanche.

## Features
- Multi-chain embedded wallet creation and management
- Multiple authentication methods (email/password, social login, Web3)
- EIP-1193 provider compatibility for seamless dApp integration
- Programmable transaction policies and gas sponsorship
- Session key management for temporary authorized access
- Server-side and client-side SDKs
- Smart contract interaction utilities

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @openfort/openfort-js @openfort/openfort-node
npm install ethers viem
```

### 2. Configuration

```typescript
// Initialize Openfort with client and server configurations
// Client side
const openfortClient = new Openfort({
  baseConfiguration: {
    publishableKey: "YOUR_OPENFORT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY",
  },
  shieldConfiguration: {
    shieldPublishableKey: "YOUR_SHIELD_PUBLISHABLE_KEY",
  },
});

// Server side
const openfortServer = new Openfort("YOUR_SECRET_KEY");
```

### 3. Basic Implementation

```typescript
// Authentication
const authResponse = await openfort.logInWithEmailPassword({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "password123"
});

// Initialize Provider
const provider = await openfort.getProvider();
await provider.request({ 
  method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',
  params: [{ chainId: `0x${avalancheChain.id.toString(16)}` }]
});

// Create a gas sponsorship policy (server-side)
const policy = await openfortServer.policies.create({
  chainId: 43114, // Avalanche C-Chain
  name: "Gas Sponsorship Policy",
  strategy: {
    sponsorSchema: "pay_for_user"
  }
});

// Create transaction intent with sponsorship (server-side)
const transactionIntent = await openfortServer.transactionIntents.create({
  player: "PLAYER_ID",
  chainId: 43114,
  optimistic: true,
  policy: policy.id,
  interactions: [{
    contract: "CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
    functionName: "transfer",
    functionArgs: [recipientAddress, amount]
  }]
});

// Sign and send the sponsored transaction (client-side)
const response = await openfortClient.sendSignatureTransactionIntentRequest(
  transactionIntent.id,
  transactionIntent.nextAction.payload.userOperationHash
);
```
