## Overview

ZeroDev is a comprehensive account abstraction toolkit built on ERC-4337 that empowers developers to create more user-friendly blockchain applications. It provides everything needed to integrate smart accounts into dApps, including gasless transactions, batch transactions, and session keys for simplified authentication flows.

## Features

- **Smart Accounts**: Implement fully ERC-4337 compliant smart contract accounts that enhance security and user experience.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Enable sponsorship of gas fees for users, eliminating the need for them to hold native tokens.
- **Bundled Transactions**: Combine multiple transactions into one for better UX and lower overall gas costs.
- **Session Keys**: Allow users to authorize specific actions for a limited time without needing to sign every transaction.
- **Social Login**: Integrate with email, social media, and passkey authentication for seamless user onboarding.
- **Multi-chain Support**: Deploy and manage smart accounts across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **Modular Architecture**: Customize account implementation based on specific application needs.
