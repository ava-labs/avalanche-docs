## Getting Started

To integrate MoonPay into your application:

1. **Register for an Account**: Sign up on the [MoonPay Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.moonpay.com/) to get your API credentials.

2. **Choose Integration Method**: MoonPay offers several integration options:

   - **Widget Integration**: The simplest approach, using a pre-built widget:
     ```javascript
     const moonpayUrl = new URL('https://buy.moonpay.com');
     moonpayUrl.searchParams.append('apiKey', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
     moonpayUrl.searchParams.append('currencyCode', 'avax');
     moonpayUrl.searchParams.append('walletAddress', userWalletAddress);
     
     window.open(moonpayUrl.href, '_blank');
     ```

   - **Web SDK Integration**: For more control and a seamless experience:
     ```bash
     npm install @moonpay/moonpay-web-sdk
     ```
     
     ```javascript
     import { MoonPayWebSdk } from '@moonpay/moonpay-web-sdk';
     
     const moonpay = new MoonPayWebSdk({
       flow: 'buy',
       environment: 'production', // or 'sandbox' for testing
       variant: 'overlay', // or 'embedded'
       params: {
         apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
         currencyCode: 'avax',
         walletAddress: userWalletAddress,
         baseCurrencyCode: 'usd',
         baseCurrencyAmount: 100,
         externalTransactionId: 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID', // Optional 
         theme: 'light', // or 'dark'
         showWalletAddressForm: true,
         lockAmount: false
       }
     });
     
     // Open the widget
     moonpay.show();
     
     // Listen to events
     moonpay.on('onClose', () => {
       console.log('Widget closed');
     });
     
     moonpay.on('onTransactionSuccess', (data) => {
       console.log('Transaction created:', data);
     });
     ```

   - **React SDK**:
     ```bash
     npm install @moonpay/moonpay-react-sdk
     ```
     
     ```jsx
     import { MoonPayProvider, useMoonPaySdk } from '@moonpay/moonpay-react-sdk';
     
     function BuyButton() {
       const { showWidget } = useMoonPaySdk();
       
       const handleClick = () => {
         showWidget({
           flow: 'buy',
           params: {
             apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
             currencyCode: 'avax',
             walletAddress: userWalletAddress
           }
         });
       };
       
       return <button onClick={handleClick}>Buy AVAX</button>;
     }
     
     function App() {
       return (
         <MoonPayProvider>
           <BuyButton />
         </MoonPayProvider>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Implement Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive transaction status updates:
   ```javascript
   // Example server-side webhook handler (Express.js)
   app.post('/moonpay-webhook', (req, res) => {
     const event = req.body;
     
     if (event.type === 'transaction_complete') {
       // Handle completed transaction
     }
     
     res.sendStatus(200);
   });
   ```

4. **Test in Sandbox**: Use the sandbox environment to test your integration before going live.
