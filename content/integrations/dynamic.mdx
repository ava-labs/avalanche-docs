## Overview

Dynamic provides the simplest way for developers to onboard their users to their apps, whether they are a crypto enthusiast or newcomer to the space. Dynamic achieves this through offering a growing suite of tools catered to embedded wallets, authentication, multi-chain experiences, and user management.

## Features

- Embedded Wallets: Spin up flexible, non-custodial embedded wallets, and focus on building experiences that matter. Abstract the complexity of crypto away from users, and onboard them with familiar and customizable UX.
- Authentication: Dynamic provides secure and seamless authentication, with the ability for end-users to protect their wallets further with Passkeys, MFA, one-time codes, and more.
- Multi-Chain Wallet Adaptor: Through Dynamic, end-users can connect hundreds of different wallets across EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, Starknet, and more. We support more chains and wallets than any other Web3 auth provider. Additionally, users can get started with SMS, email, or familiar social login options.
- User Management Solution: Dynamic allows developers to assign their end-users roles & permissions, present custom onboarding flows, and manage everything through a robust dashboard.
