HyperSDK is a high performance, customizable framework for building virtual machines for blockchains in the Avalanche network. The HyperSDK aims to provide good defaults, making it simple to build high performance blockchains, while enabling customization at each level of the stack.

Many blockchains are powered by a single Virtual Machine (VM) that is optimized for general-purpose use cases, such as the EVM or a MoveVM. The application logic is implemented in smart contracts that run on top of the VM. While this approach allows anyone do deploy their application on the blockchain, this additional layer introduces inefficiencies and complexity.

Multi-chain systems, like Avalanche, allow for the customization of the execution layer of the blockchain. They have the ability to run multiple blockchains with customized Virtual Machines. This gives developers the option to implement their application logic into the Virtual Machine itself. With that each blockchain's VM is optimized for specialized use cases and much more efficient that building on top of a general-purpose VM.

## Why Take This Course?

This course will teach you how to build a special-purpose VM utilizing the HyperSDK. It will enable you to build high-performance blockchain applications that wouldn't be possible with a general-purpose VM.

## Course Content

- **Introduction to HyperSDK:** Learn about the HyperSDK and its architecture.
- **Creating Actions:** Learn how to create custom actions in HyperSDK.
- **Registering Actions:** Learn how to register your custom actions with the VM.
- **Testing Actions:** Learn how to test your custom actions in HyperSDK.
- **State Management:** Learn how to manage state in HyperSDK.

## Prerequisites

### Avalanche
This course is meant for people with a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

- **Virtual Machines:** What they are and what VM customization means
- **Avalanche L1s & Blockchains:** What the difference between a VM, Blockchain, and an Avalanche L1 is

If any of this is unclear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals and Multi-Chain Architecture courses first.

### Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

- **Golang:** Familiarity with most concepts of the language. All exercises will mainly consist of writing Golang code.
- **Docker Compose:** The exercises of the course will occur in contained environments for easy setup. It will help if you're generally familiar with the concept of containerization, docker, and docker compose.
- **Testing:** Having some experience or familiarity with unit testing is ideal.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

- ...

Overall, this course aims to provide an advanced understanding of HyperSDK. By completing this course, students will be better prepared to build advanced blockchain applications.
