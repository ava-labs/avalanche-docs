To make easier your journey through this course, we have prepared a HyperSDK Starter Kit [repo](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk-starter-kit) consisting of everything you will need to start developing your own HyperSDK based virtual machine on Avalanche. This repo will provide a containerized environment with the following components:

- Boilerplate VM based on MorpheusVM
- Universal frontend
- Metamask Snap wallet

You can follow the course without the need of installing anything and you can just launch the environment in a Development Container.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (recent version)
- Optional: Golang v1.22.5+
- Optional: NodeJS v20+
- Optional: [Metamask Flask](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask-flask-developmen/ljfoeinjpaedjfecbmggjgodbgkmjkjk). Disable normal Metamask, Core wallet, and other wallets. Do not use your real private key with Flask.
