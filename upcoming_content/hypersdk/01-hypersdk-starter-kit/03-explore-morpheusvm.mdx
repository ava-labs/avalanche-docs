The HyperSDK Starter Kit includes MorpheusVM, the simplest HyperSDK VM. It just implements a single action (Transfer) for moving funds and tracking balances.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Connect Wallet

Open http://localhost:5173 to see the frontend.

We recommend using a Snap (requires [Metamask Flask](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask-flask-developmen/ljfoeinjpaedjfecbmggjgodbgkmjkjk)) for the full experience, but a temporary wallet works too.

<Step>

## Execute a read-only action

Actions can be executed on-chain (in a transaction) with results saved to a block, or off-chain (read-only). MorpheusVM has one action. Try executing it read-only. It shows expected balances of the sender and receiver.

##  Issue a transaction

Execute the Transfer action on-chain. This will move funds from the sender to the receiver. Click "Execute in transaction". All fields are pre-filled with default values.

After the block ins finalized, the transaction appears in the right column. This column shows all non-empty blocks on the chain.

## Check the Logs

Logs are located inside the Docker container. To view them, you'll need to open a bash terminal inside the container and navigate to the folder with the current network:

```bash
docker exec -it devnet bash -c "cd /root/.tmpnet/networks/latest_morpheusvm-e2e-tests && bash"
```

This isn't the best developer experience, and we're working on improving it.
