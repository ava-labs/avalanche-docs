## Add Your Own Custom Action

Think of actions in HyperSDK like functions in EVMs. They have inputs, outputs, and execution logic.

Let's add the Greeting action. This action doesnâ€™t change anything; it simply prints your balance and the current date. However, if it's executed in a transaction, the output will be recorded in a block on the chain.


### Create an Action File

We will create a simple `Greeting` action that will greet the user with their name, the current date, and their balance. This action will not change the state of the chain, but it will read the user's balance.

Place the following code in `actions/greeting.go`. The code includes some comments, but for more details, check out the [docs folder in HyperSDK](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/tree/main/docs).

```go title="actions/greeting.go"
package actions

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/ids"

	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk-starter/consts"
	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk-starter/storage"
	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/chain"
	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/codec"
	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/state"
	"github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/utils"
)

// Please see chain.Action interface description for more information
var _ chain.Action = (*Greeting)(nil)

// Action struct. All "serialize" marked fields will be saved on chain
type Greeting struct {
	Name string `serialize:"true" json:"name"`
}

// TypeID, has to be unique across all actions
func (*Greeting) GetTypeID() uint8 {
	return consts.HiID
}

// All database keys that could be touched during execution.
// Will fail if a key is missing or has wrong permissions
func (g *Greeting) StateKeys(actor codec.Address) state.Keys {
	return state.Keys{
		string(storage.BalanceKey(actor)): state.Read,
	}
}

// The "main" function of the action
func (g *Greeting) Execute(
	ctx context.Context,
	_ chain.Rules,
	mu state.Mutable, // That's how we read and write to the database
	timestamp int64, // Timestamp of the block or the time of simulation
	actor codec.Address, // Whoever signed the transaction, or a placeholder address in case of read-only action
	_ ids.ID, // actionID
) (codec.Typed, error) {
	balance, err := storage.GetBalance(ctx, mu, actor)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	currentTime := time.Unix(timestamp/1000, 0).Format("January 2, 2006")
	greeting := fmt.Sprintf(
		"Hi, dear %s! Today, %s, your balance is %s %s.",
		g.Name,
		currentTime,
		utils.FormatBalance(balance),
		consts.Symbol,
	)

	return &GreetingResult{
		Greeting: greeting,
	}, nil
}

// How many compute units to charge for executing this action. Can be dynamic based on the action.
func (*Greeting) ComputeUnits(chain.Rules) uint64 {
	return 1
}

// ValidRange is the timestamp range (in ms) that this [Action] is considered valid.
// -1 means no start/end
func (*Greeting) ValidRange(chain.Rules) (int64, int64) {
	return -1, -1
}

// Result of execution of greeting action
type GreetingResult struct {
	Greeting string `serialize:"true" json:"greeting"`
}

// Has to implement codec.Typed for on-chain serialization
var _ codec.Typed = (*GreetingResult)(nil)

// TypeID of the action result, could be the same as the action ID
func (g *GreetingResult) GetTypeID() uint8 {
	return consts.HiID
}
```

Notice how the action requires state keys for the balance. This is because the action reads the balance from the database. The `Execute` function is where the action logic is defined. The `GreetingResult` struct is the output of the action.
