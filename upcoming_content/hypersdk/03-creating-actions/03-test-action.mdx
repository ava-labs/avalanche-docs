### Test on Frontend
HyperSDK uses ABI, an autogenerated description of all the actions in your VM. Thanks to this, the frontend already knows how to interact with your new action. Every action you add will be displayed on the frontend and supported by the wallet as soon as the node restarts.

Now, enter your name and see the result:

You can also send it as a transaction, but this doesn't make much sense since thereâ€™s nothing to write to the chain's state.


### Next Steps
Congrats! You've just created your first action for HyperSDK.

This covers nearly half of what you need to build your own blockchain on HyperSDK. The remaining part is state management, which you can explore in `storage/storage.go`. Dive in and enjoy your journey!
