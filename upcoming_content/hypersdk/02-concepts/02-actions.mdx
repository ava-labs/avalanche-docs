Actions represent the smallest unit of customization in the HyperSDK. Each action is packaged and signed within a transaction type defined by the HyperSDK, which allows developers to focus exclusively on their application logic.

Actions implement the following `chain.Action` interface. It requires additional functions to provide state prefetching, pessimistic concurrency control, and multi-dimensional fees.

```go
ComputeUnits(Rules) uint64
StateKeys(actor codec.Address) state.Keys
GetTypeID() uint8
ValidRange(Rules) (start int64, end int64)
Execute(
       ctx context.Context,
       r Rules,
       mu state.Mutable,
       timestamp int64,
       actor codec.Address,
       actionID ids.ID,
   ) (outputs [][]byte, err error)
```

## Fees and Pessimistic Concurrency Control
StateKeys() provides a description of exactly how key-value pairs in the state will be manipulated during the action's execution. This method returns the set of keys and the set of permissions that are required to operate on them (ie. Read/Write/Allocate).

For example, a Transfer action implements this method as:

```go
func (t *Transfer) StateKeys(actor codec.Address) state.Keys {
 return state.Keys{
  string(storage.BalanceKey(actor)): state.Read | state.Write,
  string(storage.BalanceKey(t.To)):  state.All,
 }
}
```

This indicates that the actor's balance key can be read or written, but will not be allocated during execution. The To address may be read, written, or allocated, since transferring may allocate a new account in storage.

`ComputeUnits()` returns a measure of the units of compute required to execute the action.

These functions, along with the size of the action itself, determine the total amount of each resource (bandwidth, compute, read, write, and allocate) consumed by the action. The HyperSDK uses this information to calculate the fees required by the action.

## Action Validity

`GetTypeID()` returns a unique identifier of the action.

`ValidRange()` returns the start and stop timestamp where the action is considered valid.

## Action Execution

Finally, each action implements an `Execute()` function, which performs the state transition described by the action.

This is typically structured as follows:
- Check the required invariants
- If the invariants hold, update the state

For the Transfer action it could be implemented as:

- Verify the memo field is less than the maximum length
- Check the sender has the required balance
- Transfer the specified value from the sender to receiver

```go
func (t *Transfer) Execute(
	ctx context.Context,
	_ chain.Rules,
	mu state.Mutable,
	_ int64,
	actor codec.Address,
	_ ids.ID,
) (codec.Typed, error) {
	if t.Value == 0 {
		return nil, ErrOutputValueZero
	}
	if len(t.Memo) > MaxMemoSize {
		return nil, ErrOutputMemoTooLarge
	}
	senderBalance, err := storage.SubBalance(ctx, mu, actor, t.Value)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	receiverBalance, err := storage.AddBalance(ctx, mu, t.To, t.Value, true)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &TransferResult{
		SenderBalance:   senderBalance,
		ReceiverBalance: receiverBalance,
	}, nil
}
```
