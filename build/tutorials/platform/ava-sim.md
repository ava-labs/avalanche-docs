# Avalanche Local Simulator

`ava-sim` makes it easy for anyone to spin up a local instance of an Avalanche network to interact with the [Avalanche standard APIs](https://docs.avax.network/build/avalanchego-apis) or to test a [custom VM](create-custom-blockchain.md).

Detailed instructions can be found on the [github README](https://github.com/ava-labs/ava-sim#readme).

This tool is **NOT** intended to be a full-fledged node automation framework.
Rather, it is meant to be a simple tool for anyone to get started with
Avalanche.

If you are looking for a more powerful framework, check out [avash](../../tools/avash.md). This tool lets
you run multiple versions of the same binary and provide custom node configs.
