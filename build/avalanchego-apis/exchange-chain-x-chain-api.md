# Exchange Chain \(X-Chain\) API

The [X-Chain](../../learn/platform-overview/#exchange-chain-x-chain), Avalanche’s native platform for creating and trading assets, is an instance of the Avalanche Virtual Machine \(AVM\). This API allows clients to create and trade assets on the X-Chain and other instances of the AVM.

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD-IOd1nvFo" %}

## Format

This API uses the `json 2.0` RPC format. For more information on making JSON RPC calls, see [here](issuing-api-calls.md).

## Endpoints

`/ext/bc/X` to interact with the X-Chain.

`/ext/bc/blockchainID` to interact with other AVM instances, where `blockchainID` is the ID of a blockchain running the AVM.

## Methods

### avm.buildGenesis

Given a JSON representation of this Virtual Machine’s genesis state, create the byte representation of that state.

#### **Endpoint**

This call is made to the AVM’s static API endpoint:

`/ext/vm/avm`

Note: addresses should not include a chain prefix \(ie. X-\) in calls to the static API endpoint because these prefixes refer to a specific chain.

#### **Signature**

```cpp
avm.buildGenesis({
    networkID: int,
    genesisData: JSON,
    encoding: string, //optional
}) -> {
    bytes: string,
    encoding: string,
}
```

Encoding specifies the encoding format to use for arbitrary bytes ie. the genesis bytes that are returned. Can be either “cb58” or “hex”. Defaults to “cb58”.

`genesisData` has this form:

```cpp
{
"genesisData" :
    {
        "assetAlias1": {               // Each object defines an asset
            "name": "human readable name",
            "symbol":"AVAL",           // Symbol is between 0 and 4 characters
            "initialState": {
                "fixedCap" : [         // Choose the asset type.
                    {                  // Can be "fixedCap", "variableCap", "limitedTransfer", "nonFungible"
                        "amount":1000, // At genesis, address A has
                        "address":"A"  // 1000 units of asset
                    },
                    {
                        "amount":5000, // At genesis, address B has
                        "address":"B"  // 1000 units of asset
                    },
                    ...                // Can have many initial holders
                ]
            }
        },
        "assetAliasCanBeAnythingUnique": { // Asset alias can be used in place of assetID in calls
            "name": "human readable name", // names need not be unique
            "symbol": "AVAL",              // symbols need not be unique
            "initialState": {
                "variableCap" : [          // No units of the asset exist at genesis
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signature of A or B can mint more of
                            "A",           // the asset.
                            "B"
                        ],
                        "threshold":1
                    },
                    {
                        "minters": [       // The signatures of 2 of A, B and C can mint
                            "A",           // more of the asset
                            "B",
                            "C"
                        ],
                        "threshold":2
                    },
                    ...                    // Can have many minter sets
                ]
            }
        },
        ...                                // Can list more assets

### avm.getUTXOs

Gets the UTXOs that reference a given address. If sourceChain is specified, then it will retrieve the atomic UTXOs exported from that chain to the X Chain.

#### **Signature**

```cpp
avm.getUTXOs({
    addresses: []string,
    limit: int, //optional
    startIndex: { //optional
        address: string,
        utxo: string
    },
    sourceChain: string, //optional
    encoding: string, //optional
}) -> {
    numFetched: int,
    utxos: []string,
    endIndex: {
        address: string,
        utxo: string
    },
    encoding: string
}
```

* `utxos` is a list of UTXOs such that each UTXO references at least one address in `addresses`.
* At most `limit` UTXOs are returned. If `limit` is omitted or greater than 1024, it is set to 1024.
* This method supports pagination. `endIndex` denotes the last UTXO returned. To get the next set of UTXOs, use the value of `endIndex` as `startIndex` in the next call.
* If `startIndex` is omitted, will fetch all UTXOs up to `limit`.
* When using pagination \(when `startIndex` is provided\), UTXOs are not guaranteed to be unique across multiple calls. That is, a UTXO may appear in the result of the first call, and then again in the second call.
* When using pagination, consistency is not guaranteed across multiple calls. That is, the UTXO set of the addresses may have changed between calls.
* `encoding` sets the format for the returned UTXOs. Can be either “cb58” or “hex”. Defaults to “cb58”.

#### **Example**

Suppose we want all UTXOs that reference at least one of `X-avax1yzt57wd8me6xmy3t42lz8m5lg6yruy79m6whsf` and `X-avax1x459sj0ssujguq723cljfty4jlae28evjzt7xz`.

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{

        "encoding": "cb58"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

    },
    "id": 1
}
```

Since `numFetched` is the same as `limit`, we can tell that there may be more UTXOs that were not fetched. We call the method again, this time with `startIndex`:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{

Since `numFetched` is less than `limit`, we know that we are done fetching UTXOs and don’t need to call this method again.

Suppose we want to fetch the UTXOs exported from the P Chain to the X Chain in order to build an ImportTx. Then we need to call GetUTXOs with the sourceChain argument in order to retrieve the atomic UTXOs:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"avm.getUTXOs",
    "params" :{
        "addresses":["X-avax1yzt57wd8me6xmy3t42lz8m5lg6yruy79m6whsf", "X-avax1x459sj0ssujguq723cljfty4jlae28evjzt7xz"],
        "limit":5,
        "sourceChain": "P",
        "encoding": "cb58"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

This gives response:

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "numFetched": "1",
        "utxos": [
