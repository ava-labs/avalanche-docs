Note that when running with `leveldb`, the node can't read data that was persisted when running with `rocksdb`, and vice-versa.

**Two important notes about RocksDB**: First, RocksDB does not work on all computers. 
Second, RocksDB is not built by default and is not included in publicly released binaries.
To build AvalancheGo with RocksDB, run `export ROCKSDBALLOWED=1` in your terminal and then `scripts/build.sh`. You must do this before you can use `--db-type=rocksdb`. 

### Genesis

### HTTP Server

`--http-host` \(string\):

The address that HTTP APIs listen on. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. This means that by default, your node can only handle API calls made from the same machine. To allow API calls from other machines, use `--http-host=`.

`--http-port` \(int\):

Each node runs an HTTP server that provides the APIs for interacting with the node and the Avalanche network. This argument specifies the port that the HTTP server will listen on. The default value is `9650`.

### Logging

`--log-level` \(string, `{Off, Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Verbo}`\):

The log level determines which events to log. There are 7 different levels, in order from highest priority to lowest.

- `Off`: No logs have this level of logging.
- `Fatal`: Fatal errors that are not recoverable.
- `Error`: Errors that the node encounters, these errors were able to be recovered.
- `Warn`: A Warning that might be indicative of a spurious byzantine node, or potential future error.
- `Info`: Useful descriptions of node status updates.
- `Debug`: Debug logging is useful when attempting to understand possible bugs in the code. More information that would be typically desired for normal usage will be displayed.
- `Verbo`: Tracks extensive amounts of information the node is processing. This includes message contents and binary dumps of data for extremely low level protocol analysis.

When specifying a log level note that all logs with the specified priority or higher will be tracked. Defaults to `Info`.

`--log-display-level` \(string, `{Off, Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Verbo}`\):

The log level determines which events to display to the screen. If left blank, will default to the value provided to `--log-level`.

`--log-display-highlight` \(string, `{auto, plain, colors}`\):

Whether to color/highlight display logs. Default highlights when the output is a terminal. Otherwise, should be one of `{auto, plain, colors}`

### Public IP

`--public-ip` \(string\):

Validators must know their public facing IP addresses so they can let other nodes know how to connect to them. If this argument is not provided, the node will attempt to perform NAT traversal to get the node’s public IP. Should be set to `127.0.0.1` to create a local network. If not set, attempts to learn IP using NAT traversal.

`--dynamic-public-ip` \(string\):

Valid values if param is present: `opendns`, `ifconfigco` or `ifconfigme`. This overrides `--public-ip`. If set, will poll the remote service every `--dynamic-update-duration` and update the node’s public IP address.

`--dynamic-update-duration` \(duration\):

The time between poll events for `--dynamic-public-ip` or NAT traversal. The recommended minimum is 1 minute. Defaults to `5m`.

### Signature Verification

`--signature-verification-enabled` \(boolean\):

Enables signature verification. When set to `false`, signatures won’t be checked in VMs that allow signatures to be disabled. Defaults to `true`.

### Staking

`--staking-port` \(string\):

The port through which the staking server will connect to the Avalanche network externally. Defaults to `9651`.

`--staking-enabled` \(boolean\):

Avalanche uses Proof of Stake \(PoS\) as Sybil resistance to make it prohibitively expensive to attack the network. If false, sybil resistance is disabled and all peers will be sampled during consensus. Defaults to `true`.

`--staking-tls-cert-file` \(string, file path\):

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely connect nodes. This argument specifies the location of the TLS certificate used by the node. By default, the node expects the TLS certificate to be at `$HOME/.avalanchego/staking/staker.crt`.

`--staking-tls-key-file` \(string, file path\):

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely connect nodes. This argument specifies the location of the TLS private key used by the node. By default, the node expects the TLS private key to be at `$HOME/.avalanchego/staking/staker.key`.

`--staking-disabled-weight` \(int\):

Weight to provide to each peer when staking is disabled. Defaults to `1`.

### Version

`--version` \(boolean\)

If this is `true`, print the version and quit. Defaults to `false`.

## Advanced Options

The following options may affect the correctness of a node. Only power users should change these.

`--benchlist-min-failing-duration` \(duration\):

Minimum amount of time messages to a peer must be failing before the peer is benched. Defaults to `5m`.

### Build Directory

`--build-dir` \(string\):

Specifies where to find AvalancheGo sub-binaries & plugin binaries. Defaults to the path of executed AvalancheGo binary.
The structure of this directory must be as follows:

```
build-dir  
|_avalanchego-latest  
    |_avalanchego-process (the binary from compiling the app directory)  
    |_plugins  
      |_evm  
      |_other_plugin
|_avalanchego-preupgrade  
    |_avalanchego-process (the binary from compiling the app directory)  
    |_plugins  
      |_evm  
      |_other_plugin
```

### Chain Configs

Some chains \(right now, just the C-Chain\) allow the node operator to provide a custom configuration. AvalancheGo can read chain configurations from files and pass them to the corresponding chains on initialization.

AvalancheGo looks for these files in the directory specified by `--chain-config-dir`. This directory can have sub-directories whose names are chain IDs or chain aliases. Each sub-directory contains the configuration for the chain specified in the directory name. Each sub-directory should contain a file named `config`, whose value is passed in when the corresponding chain is initialized. For example, the config for the C-Chain should be at: `[chain-config-dir-goes-here]/C/config.json`.

The extension that these files should have, and the contents of these files, is VM-dependent. For example, some chains may expect `config.txt` while others expect `config.json`. If multiple files are provided with the same name but different extensions \(e.g. `config.json` and `config.txt`\) in the same sub-directory, AvalancheGo will exit with an error.

For a given chain, AvalancheGo will look first for a config sub-directory whose name is the chain ID. If it isn't found, it looks for a config sub-directory whose name is the chain's primary alias. If it's not found, it looks for a config sub-directory whose name is another alias for the chain. All folder and file names are case sensitive.

It is not required to provide these custom configurations. If they are not provided, a VM-specific default config will be used.

`--chain-config-dir` \(string\):

Specifies the directory that contains chain configs, as described above. Defaults to `$HOME/.avalanchego/configs/chains`. If this flag is not provided and the default directory does not exist, AvalancheGo will not exit since custom configs are optional. However, if the flag is set, the specified folder must exist, or AvalancheGo will exit with an error.

#### C-Chain Configs

Currently, the C-Chain is the only chain that supports custom configurations. In order to specify a config for the C-Chain, a JSON config file should be placed at `{chain-config-dir}/C/config.json` \(or another valid location, as specified above.\)

For example if `chain-config-dir` has the default value, then `config.json` can be placed at `$HOME/.avalanchego/configs/chains/C/config.json`, with these contents:

```javascript
{
  "rpc-tx-fee-cap": 90,
  "eth-api-enabled": true,
  "tx-pool-api-enabled": true,
  "debug-api-enabled": true,
  "web3-api-enabled": true
}
```

For more information about C-Chain configs, see [here](command-line-interface.md#coreth-config).

### C-Chain / Coreth <a id="coreth-config"></a>

`--coreth-config` \(json\):

\(This argument is deprecated in favor of using [Chain Configs](command-line-interface.md#chain-configs).\)

This allows you to specify a config to be passed into the C-Chain. The default values for this config are:

```javascript
{
  "snowman-api-enabled": false,
  "coreth-admin-api-enabled": false,
  "net-api-enabled": true,
  "rpc-gas-cap": 2500000000,
  "rpc-tx-fee-cap": 100,

  "debug-api-enabled": false,
  "web3-api-enabled": true,
  "local-txs-enabled": false,
  "pruning-enabled": false,
  "api-max-duration": 0, // Default to no maximum
  "api-max-blocks-per-request": 0, // Default to no maximum
