# Style Guide

We strongly recommend to follow [Google's Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) when writing developer docs except the following:

- Title cases are used in capitalization in titles and headings, rather than [sentence case](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization#capitalization-in-titles-and-headings). Use [this website](https://titlecase.com/) to convert to proper title cases.
- When referencing to Subnet in text, upper case S as in **S**ubnet is always used.
- Official project/product names:
  - AvalancheGo for https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
  - Coreth for https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth
  - Subnet-EVM for https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm
  - Avalanche-CLI for https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli
