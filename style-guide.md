# Style Guide

This repository follows
[Google's Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
with the following exceptions:

- Use Title cases for capitalization in titles and headings, rather than
  [sentence case](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization#capitalization-in-titles-and-headings).
  Use [this website](https://titlecase.com/) to convert to proper title case.
- All words `Subnet` should have first letter upper-cased, except in the context of a command, path
  or logs.
